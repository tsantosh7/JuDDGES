But he passed a sentence of two months in respect of offence 3 and a consecutive sentence of six months in respect of offence 8 (both being summary only offences). The result, therefore, was that the aggregate of the sentences imposed for the three summary only offences (offences 3, 8 and 10) was one of 14 months when the Recorder's power was limited to imposing an aggregate sentence of six months. Accordingly, before we consider the totality argument that has been raised on behalf of the appellant, we make the necessary adjustments to those sentences, to reduce the aggregate of them to no more than six months.

Lynne O'Connell, who ran a business called RSVP from her home, engaged some casual Christmas staff in 2006. This included the appellant, who is a son of a friend of hers. The work entailed being mainly in the outbuilding of her house, but the staff were allowed into the house to use the lavatory and kitchen. On 14 December 2006 the appellant went into an area of the house where he was not permitted to be. He stole £400 in Swiss francs from a little box where they were kept.5. The appellant attended court in respect of this matter on 12 January 2007. However, in the meantime, on 3 January he took from his mother's handbag £20 and the keys to her safe (offence 2). He then took her car keys from the safe, drove the car to a public house, parked it and smashed its window to make it look as if somebody else had taken the car (offence 3). He was also charged with having no licence and no insurance on that occasion (offences 4 and 5). It seems that he has never had a licence of any description. The print-out from the DVLC came back as ""no trace"", despite his having had six penalty points imposed on him in respect of a previous offence of driving without insurance.6. On 8 September 2007 the appellant attempted a burglary at 33 Potter's Crescent, Ash. He did not manage to complete that offence because he was heard damaging the patio doors which he had forced open at the rear (offence 9). He then went into 31 Chester Road, where the door was open as people were coming and going (offence 6). He stole car keys and then took a Ford Focus car (offence 8). A postman saw the appellant behaving oddly. The vehicle was found in the street in a damaged condition. 7. Having left the Ford Focus, the appellant went on to a house called ""Aniryss"" at Thunder Hill (offence 7). He took a Volvo from outside that house. The Volvo had a Tracker fitted which enabled the police to work out where he was. He drove the vehicle into a police car, got out and ran away (offences 10, 12 and 13). He was seen by an off-duty police officer who managed to trap him in a garage. The appellant assaulted the police officer with intent to resist arrest by picking up a trowel which was in the garage and hitting the officer in the face with it (offence 11).",Male & Female,['VicSex']

There is an obvious contrast with section 20 of the same Act. Under that section the same injury must be proved, but the commission of the offence does not depend on proof of intention to cause it. The difference lies in the criminality of the defendant's intention. That is a significant difference, reflected in the maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment on conviction under section 20. The seriousness with which section 18 offences are regarded is evident not only in the severity of the potential punishment but also in the fact that a section 18 conviction ranks as 'a serious offence' for the purposes of section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.
