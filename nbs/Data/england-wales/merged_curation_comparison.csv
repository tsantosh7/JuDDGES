Comment: Victim 1: individual female","Exact: 4. We turn to the facts. The facts relating to offence 1 are these. Lynne O'Connell, who ran a business called RSVP from her home, engaged some casual Christmas staff in 2006. This included the appellant, who is a son of a friend of hers. The work entailed being mainly in the outbuilding of her house, but the staff were allowed into the house to use the lavatory and kitchen. On 14 December 2006 the appellant went into an area of the house where he was not permitted to be. He stole £400 in Swiss francs from a little box where they were kept.5. The appellant attended court in respect of this matter on 12 January 2007. However, in the meantime, on 3 January he took from his mother's handbag £20 and the keys to her safe (offence 2). He then took her car keys from the safe, drove the car to a public house, parked it and smashed its window to make it look as if somebody else had taken the car (offence 3). He was also charged with having no licence and no insurance on that occasion (offences 4 and 5). It seems that he has never had a licence of any description. The print-out from the DVLC came back as ""no trace"", despite his having had six penalty points imposed on him in respect of a previous offence of driving without insurance.6. On 8 September 2007 the appellant attempted a burglary at 33 Potter's Crescent, Ash. He did not manage to complete that offence because he was heard damaging the patio doors which he had forced open at the rear (offence 9). He then went into 31 Chester Road, where the door was open as people were coming and going (offence 6). He stole car keys and then took a Ford Focus car (offence 8). A postman saw the appellant behaving oddly. The vehicle was found in the street in a damaged condition. 7. Having left the Ford Focus, the appellant went on to a house called ""Aniryss"" at Thunder Hill (offence 7). He took a Volvo from outside that house. The Volvo had a Tracker fitted which enabled the police to work out where he was. He drove the vehicle into a police car, got out and ran away (offences 10, 12 and 13). He was seen by an off-duty police officer who managed to trap him in a garage. The appellant assaulted the police officer with intent to resist arrest by picking up a trowel which was in the garage and hitting the officer in the face with it (offence 11).;

Mr Wheatcroft stated that he spoke to a woman with whom he was acquainted about some roofing felt that he had supplied.

The leg area of the jeans yielded one particle of prima residue of lead, barium and antimony with a low level of silicone. There was a trace of nitro-glycerine from the right of the hooded top. This evidence did not prove directly that the residues found on the clothes must have come from the shooting outside Uniseven on 2nd January. It was however consistent with it, and it was, of course, open to the jury to consider whether any inferences should properly be drawn from the additional fact that the hooded top and jeans were not found where they would normally be, in their owner’s house rather than the garden.;

Exact: The previous convictions were adduced before the jury by a police officer, Detective Sergeant Dale. He had no personal knowledge of any of the previous offences and what he was able to impart to the court came entirely from the Police National Computer. He referred to a conviction before the Wigan Magistrates in 1992 for common assault. He said that the print-out from the computer stated that the appellant had been asked to leave a shop and had punched a 22 year old to the face resulting in cuts and bruising. The second conviction was in 1995 at Abergavenny Magistrates' Court and according to Sergeant Dale concerned the use of a pool cue to hit the complainant. He then referred to a conviction in 1997 in the Wigan Magistrates' Court for threatening behaviour, adding that the facts were reported as being a punch by the defendant to an unknown male and abuse to police officers. The most recent conviction was in 2004, again in the Wigan Magistrates' Court, for common assault, the allegation being that the appellant had struck a 14 year old male in a shop.;

In general terms, Gregory declined to answer any questions, stating that he did not want to remember where he had been at the New Year because of the death of his brother. Ellis denied involvement, and at first exercised his right of silence. When he was later interviewed, he denied any involvement with the red Mondeo, and at a subsequent interview, claimed that gunshot residue found on his clothing had come from fireworks or through other innocent contact. As to the telephone calls, he claimed that it was impossible for him so long after the events to recollect any specific details. However he did not believe that his phone had been in anyone else’s possession. In his interviews, Simms effectively made no comment, but on the last occasion when he was interviewed he denied any involvement in the shooting or in the obtaining of the red Mondeo. He admitted that he was present at Uniseven at the material time, along with several members of his family, who he would not have endangered. He agreed that the phone 845 was his telephone, and asserted that he had received telephone calls while at Uniseven from different people asking him about the quality of the music, but as the music was loud there were several missed calls. In view of the lapse of time, he could not remember any other details. In due course alibi notices were served by Martin, Gregory and Ellis.;

Comment: ","Exact: On that basis the sentence of six months that he imposed for offence 10 was lawful as an individual sentence, but the Recorder could not lawfully pass an aggregate of more than six months for all the summary only offences. But he passed a sentence of two months in respect of offence 3 and a consecutive sentence of six months in respect of offence 8 (both being summary only offences). The result, therefore, was that the aggregate of the sentences imposed for the three summary only offences (offences 3, 8 and 10) was one of 14 months when the Recorder's power was limited to imposing an aggregate sentence of six months. Accordingly, before we consider the totality argument that has been raised on behalf of the appellant, we make the necessary adjustments to those sentences, to reduce the aggregate of them to no more than six months. That we would achieve by quashing the sentence of six months passed in respect of offence 8 and substituting one of two months, and quashing the sentence of six months passed in respect of offence 10 and substituting one of two months.;

Comment: ",No,,No,Don't know,No,No,"Exact: ""An offence against this section [referring to section 18] has always been regarded as of great seriousness, reflected in the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The reason is obvious. Not only must there be proof of grievous or serious injury, but that injury must have been caused intentionally or deliberately. There is an obvious contrast with section 20 of the same Act. Under that section the same injury must be proved, but the commission of the offence does not depend on proof of intention to cause it. The difference lies in the criminality of the defendant's intention. That is a significant difference, reflected in the maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment on conviction under section 20. The seriousness with which section 18 offences are regarded is evident not only in the severity of the potential punishment but also in the fact that a section 18 conviction ranks as 'a serious offence' for the purposes of section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. The consequence of that is that a second conviction of ""a serious offence"" obliges the court, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.;
