It is further argued that the judge was wrong to reject a submission that there had been an element of provocation, which provided some mitigation for the offences of violence. In this regard, counsel pointed to evidence that there had been an incident earlier that day in which Kudriasov had been injured. They argued, in the alternative, in their respective written grounds, that the judge should have found some mitigation in evidence suggesting that there may have been some kind of drugs background to the attack on Messrs Kaleckas and Likso.16. Turning to personal mitigation, both appellants submit that the judge, although he specifically referred in his sentencing remarks to the appellants' previous good character, or effective good character, failed to give sufficient weight to that aspect of the case. Counsel pray in aid that both appellants are hard-working men with family responsibilities, and that both have behaved well and made good use of their time in custody whilst on remand awaiting trial.17. Next, specific submissions are made on behalf of the appellant Apsitis to the effect that his inability to speak or read English will mean that time in custody will be harder for him than for most other prisoners. It is also submitted on his behalf that the judge should have given some weight to the fact that Apsitis had always admitted presence, and that at a plea and case management hearing he had admitted guilt of an offence of unlawful wounding.18. On behalf of the appellant Kudriasov, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that he may well have brought a golf club to the scene. It is, however, realistically acknowledged that, whether he did or not, he was part of a group who were collectively armed.19.

The complainant had been sleeping on the platform bench for some time. The appellant sat down next to her a few minutes before the train arrived. The complainant is a young lady who had been drinking earlier in the evening. She entered the first carriage and sat down next to the window in the first set of four seats. There was one other person in the carriage and he was asleep. Shortly afterwards the appellant, who had entered the third or fourth carriage, walked back through the train and entered her carriage and sat down on the sit opposite her. She was resting her foot on the seat opposite. The prosecution case was that the appellant proceeded to take hold of the foot and massage it and continued to engage in what was in fact sexual activity towards her until he got off the train at Mill Hill station. She remained on the train until St Albans. 3. When she got off the train she caught a taxi to go to the police station. She found it was closed.

A BlackBerry Messenger account is unique to the phone, but anyone can set up a BlackBerry Messenger server and use it to transfer messages untraceably.2.Photographs of the kind shown in the screenshots can be copied in from various sources, which include Facebook and other social media sites or uploaded from the internet.   The screenshots appear to be from a mobile phone, but carry no date or time, and no confirmation of who the message is from.3.There is no evidence that Choudhury sent the messages. Neither the fact that the account appears to be in Choudhury’s name, nor the fact that he is in the pictures provides such evidence.4.Without access to the telephone or to the BlackBerry Messenger account, it is not possible to check which BlackBerry Messenger  PIN number was used to send any message, or when it was sent, or to whom that PIN belonged. A person can set up many accounts and ‘talk’ to him or herself.5.The reference to a PIN in the body of the message does not take matters further. It appears to have been superimposed on the message, rather than being part of it. The fact that the PIN is in a message does not show that it is the PIN from which the message came.

The judge was entitled to make the finding of unwillingness, but it is often the case that young men and women of apparently good character are persuaded, cajoled, encouraged and sometimes pressurised into carrying, or holding, or looking after these lethal weapons. They are chosen for that purpose because it is unlikely that the police will have any interest in them, and so those who own the weapons can keep them safe and secure. The offender knew what he was doing. We find nothing in his evidence to suggest that he was under duress. Nor do we find anything in the evidence to suggest that he provided information on the kind of scale which would have enabled the police to hunt down and identify the men who had provided the weapon. We are also deeply concerned that the fact that the car in which the gun was found was used by the offender's mother and sister was treated as a mitigating factor.

He made determined efforts to sell drugs to a group of (on his own admission) 30 individuals.  Nor can his offending be regarded as a single course of conduct: the appellant sought to evade the festival’s very considerable security regime on two different days.  As the community impact statement vividly demonstrates, there is a need to deter people from exploiting a closed and susceptible group whose guard may be down as they enjoy themselves.  The context of drug supply at a festival was a further, serious aggravating factor.  All these factors warranted a further significant upward adjustment from the starting point.20.Copy link to this paragraphIn our judgment, notwithstanding the appellant’s mitigation, the seriousness of the appellant’s offences warranted an overall sentence, before discount for pleas, at the top of the category range which is, as we have said, 4½ years.  That is what the judge concluded.  The question for this Court on an appeal is whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.

He then returned to address the fact, amply established, that none of the guidelines constitute straitjackets and that judges should have the courage to depart from guidelines where it was right to do so. Addressing the facts of the case he said:
 
  
  
 ""The medical evidence shows that there was penetration, that there was ejaculation; but as I have thought about the case, the more incredible it seems to me to be that there could have been anything beginning to approach a normal act of intercourse on your part without her waking. By 'normal' I do not of course include 'consensual'. Whatever happened must have been very brief.""
 
 18. The judge then examined the guideline which suggests the approach to be taken by sentencing judges where there has been penetration other than by the penis. Having reflected on these matters and considered the offender's culpability he came to the conclusion that no real harm was caused and therefore, in accordance with section 143 and 153(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the shortest sentence possible must be passed and the sentence would therefore be one of two years' detention.",Sentencing judge did not refer to relevant sentencing guidelines ,['ReasonSentLenientNotExcess']

Although we can understand how the judge came to the view he did, in our judgment appalling though this behaviour was, it fell short of that sort of conduct which is contemplated as sadistic by the subsection. This was a very bad case of gratuitous gang violence directed at a vulnerable individual. In short, the starting point should not have been 30 years for Hughes; it should have been 15.18. The aggravating features in Hughes' case are clear. We need not repeat them. They merit a significant increase on the starting point of 15 years. Balancing the aggravating and the mitigating features, we have concluded that in his case the appropriate minimum term would be one of 19 years.19. We turn to Bonellie. He did not have the mitigation of a plea of guilty. He is younger than Hughes. He was not as involved as Hughes. He is lightly convicted. Bearing all those features in mind, and again performing the balancing exercise to which we have referred, it seems to us that the appropriate minimum term in his case would have been one of 15 years.20. Miller was the youngest. He pleaded guilty. It seems to us that in his case the appropriate minimum term would have been one of 13 years.21. In the result, therefore, we quash the minimum terms imposed by the judge. We substitute those terms to which we have just referred.

Various representations were made to her as a result of which she handed over a total of £7,000 to that man and received from that man a UK passport and UK certificate of naturalisation. She went to Romania using the documents. On arrival the fact that the documents were forged was discovered; the fact that they were forged was not in issue. Bilbie’s evidence was he had given Monica Halarescu photographs of himself and personal details. When the police searched the appellant’s address, photographs of Bilbie were found at his house. Bilbie never met the lawyer who was to obtain a British passport for him.iii)In counts 13 to 18 of the indictment, the appellant was charged with obtaining £5,000 from Stefan Iamandi, Irina Iamandi and Ion Iordache by making representations similar to those made to Maria Halarescu and attempting to obtain a further £5,000 from each of them. All three were Romanians who had entered the UK illegally in 1998. Their evidence was that they had been told of a lawyer with connections with the Home Office who could help obtain a British passport and certificate of naturalisation. In June or July 2003 they were introduced to a person they understood to be Cornel Tirnaveanu. The prosecution contended that this man was the appellant. The three had expected to meet an English lawyer but were surprised that he was a Romanian. He made various representations to them about his ability to obtain a passport and each handed to him £5,000 together with their passport photographs and details. They then learnt that a friend who had introduced them to Cornel Tirnaveanu and who had obtained a passport from him had been arrested for being in possession of a forged passport. When they were telephoned by Cornel Tirnaveanu with news that the passport was ready, they met him at a coffee shop but did not bring any money to the meeting. They were shown documents but on discovering that they had not brought the money Cornel Tirnaveanu refused to hand over the documents. When the police searched 85 Chandlers Drive they found details of these three together with photographs of Iordache. The police thereafter contacted them.iv)There were four further counts of facilitating illegal entry (counts 19, 20 and 21) and of forgery of a photocard driving licence (count 22).

When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught. 21. On examination, she was frightened and distressed. The doctor did not find any marks of violence on her body but concluded that she would have been incapable of resisting an active muscular male.22. Counts 6 and 7, attempting to render someone incapable of resistance with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm: on 1st January 1978, a 21 year old woman called Miss G had been to a nightclub in North London and was returning home alone at about 1.30 am by thumbing a lift. She was picked up by the appellant who was driving a van. She noticed that the appellant was shaking continuously and asked to get out. The vehicle was moving and the appellant said, in a fierce voice: ""No, you stop in here."" She tried to open the door but the appellant grabbed both her wrists with one hand and held her tightly. He drove to a dark street in the Victoria area and started to kiss her. She began to scream. The appellant tried to suppress her screams by putting both hands round her throat and he kept pressing to such an extent that she fainted from the pressure being applied. A female passerby was suspicious of the activity in the van and upon closer inspection saw a girl struggling with a man. She opened the passenger door and asked what was going on. This seemed to surprise the appellant, who let go of Miss G who managed to escape from the van. The appellant drove away.
