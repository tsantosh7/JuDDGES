, Comment: Acquaintance ","Exact: The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.18. Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught. 21. On examination, she was frightened and distressed. The doctor did not find any marks of violence on her body but concluded that she would have been incapable of resisting an active muscular male.22. Counts 6 and 7, attempting to render someone incapable of resistance with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm: on 1st January 1978, a 21 year old woman called Miss G had been to a nightclub in North London and was returning home alone at about 1.30 am by thumbing a lift. She was picked up by the appellant who was driving a van. She noticed that the appellant was shaking continuously and asked to get out. The vehicle was moving and the appellant said, in a fierce voice: ""No, you stop in here."" She tried to open the door but the appellant grabbed both her wrists with one hand and held her tightly. He drove to a dark street in the Victoria area and started to kiss her. She began to scream. The appellant tried to suppress her screams by putting both hands round her throat and he kept pressing to such an extent that she fainted from the pressure being applied. A female passerby was suspicious of the activity in the van and upon closer inspection saw a girl struggling with a man. She opened the passenger door and asked what was going on. This seemed to surprise the appellant, who let go of Miss G who managed to escape from the van. The appellant drove away. The passerby made a note of his registration number and called the police who traced the appellant from the registration number.

In the early hours of the morning on a day between 26th December 2003 and 1st January 2004 a prostitute was working in Derby when she came across the appellant. He asked her how much she charged for full sex and oral sex and an agreement was reached that she would perform oral sex upon him for £10. They both went to some bushes but when she started to perform the sex act on him, he immediately became aggressive and demanded full intercourse. When she refused he became violent, forced her to the ground, placed both hands round her neck and got on top of her. He then pulled her clothes off, placed his hand over her mouth so that nobody would hear her screams and then forcefully penetrated her vagina with his penis. So violent was he that she genuinely believed she was going to die. He ejaculated inside her without wearing a condom. After that, he asked her to accompany him home but when she refused he raped her again in exactly the same manner and then ran off.

Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught. 21. On examination, she was frightened and distressed. The doctor did not find any marks of violence on her body but concluded that she would have been incapable of resisting an active muscular male.22. Counts 6 and 7, attempting to render someone incapable of resistance with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm: on 1st January 1978, a 21 year old woman called Miss G had been to a nightclub in North London and was returning home alone at about 1.30 am by thumbing a lift. She was picked up by the appellant who was driving a van. She noticed that the appellant was shaking continuously and asked to get out. The vehicle was moving and the appellant said, in a fierce voice: ""No, you stop in here."" She tried to open the door but the appellant grabbed both her wrists with one hand and held her tightly. He drove to a dark street in the Victoria area and started to kiss her. She began to scream. The appellant tried to suppress her screams by putting both hands round her throat and he kept pressing to such an extent that she fainted from the pressure being applied. A female passerby was suspicious of the activity in the van and upon closer inspection saw a girl struggling with a man. She opened the passenger door and asked what was going on. This seemed to surprise the appellant, who let go of Miss G who managed to escape from the van. The appellant drove away. The passerby made a note of his registration number and called the police who traced the appellant from the registration number.

, Comment: 5","Exact: nd Nicolae Bilbie as their principal witnesses. Monica Halarescu’s evidence was she had met through Nicolae Bilbie a man who had said he was “Cornel Tirnaveanu” and that he was a lawyer working at the Home Office. It was the prosecution case that this individual was the appellant. Various representations were made to her as a result of which she handed over a total of £7,000 to that man and received from that man a UK passport and UK certificate of naturalisation. She went to Romania using the documents. On arrival the fact that the documents were forged was discovered; the fact that they were forged was not in issue. Bilbie’s evidence was he had given Monica Halarescu photographs of himself and personal details. When the police searched the appellant’s address, photographs of Bilbie were found at his house. Bilbie never met the lawyer who was to obtain a British passport for him.iii)In counts 13 to 18 of the indictment, the appellant was charged with obtaining £5,000 from Stefan Iamandi, Irina Iamandi and Ion Iordache by making representations similar to those made to Maria Halarescu and attempting to obtain a further £5,000 from each of them. All three were Romanians who had entered the UK illegally in 1998. Their evidence was that they had been told of a lawyer with connections with the Home Office who could help obtain a British passport and certificate of naturalisation. In June or July 2003 they were introduced to a person they understood to be Cornel Tirnaveanu. The prosecution contended that this man was the appellant. The three had expected to meet an English lawyer but were surprised that he was a Romanian. He made various representations to them about his ability to obtain a passport and each handed to him £5,000 together with their passport photographs and details. They then learnt that a friend who had introduced them to Cornel Tirnaveanu and who had obtained a passport from him had been arrested for being in possession of a forged passport. When they were telephoned by Cornel Tirnaveanu with news that the passport was ready, they met him at a coffee shop but did not bring any money to the meeting. They were shown documents but on discovering that they had not brought the money Cornel Tirnaveanu refused to hand over the documents. When the police searched 85 Chandlers Drive they found details of these three together with photographs of Iordache. The police thereafter contacted them.iv)There were four further counts of facilitating illegal entry (counts 19, 20 and 21) and of forgery of a photocard driving licence (count 22). It is not necessary at this stage to refer to the details of those further matters.

, Comment: Female","Exact: The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went.

, Comment: Previous convictions for drug possesion","Exact: was an 18 year old female trainee, to whom the appellant paid an increasing amount of attention. He invited her to go out with him and left messages on her mobile phone for her. From time to time he would call her away from PT and march them back to their accommodation so that they could avoid doing PT which they did not enjoy very much. The appellant was twice the young woman's age.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.18. Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught.

At the conclusion of the hearing we announced that we would impose a sentence of 10 years detention under s.228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 made up of a custodial term of seven years and an extension period of three years. We also ordered that the 265 days spent on remand is to count towards the sentence.2.We now give our reasons for that decision. The facts are very fully set up in our decision to quash the decision for manslaughter [2007] EWCA Crim 1846. We start with the judge’s sentencing remarks. He said:-Rafferty, you are, of course, in a very different position. You were convicted of manslaughter on what was referred to at trial, as the causation basis. That is the violence which you bear responsibility, made a significant contribution to the death of Ben Bellamy at the hands of Taylor and Thomas, when they drowned him. Either by rendering him unconscious, so he could not resist drowning or if he remained conscious, by reducing his ability to resist drowning at their hands. On the evidence, that I have heard, I am satisfied, so as to be sure, that you bear responsibility, not only for an element of the violence used before you went to the cash point, but also for a degree of violence used thereafter.

, Comment: nan","Exact: sentence was excessive.

, Comment: nan","Exact: 4. The present appeal is on a Reference from the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The basis of the Reference is that, if medical opinions now available had been available to the sentencing judge, the judge would have been in a position and under a duty to have imposed a Hospital Order under what is now section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983, together with a restriction order under section 41, without limitation of time, instead of a sentence of life imprisonment.

, Comment: Appellant has a mental health disorder ","Exact: It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the judge was wrong to admit the evidence and, having admitted it, had failed to give proper directions to the jury.

, Comment: Judge admitted evidence which should not have been admitted","Exact: appeal is whether the judge was right to categorise the seriousness of the murder in this case as ""particularly high"" with a starting point for an offender aged 18 or over of 30 years under Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

, Comment: Whether the seriousness category was correct","Exact: ""30. We take the view that, following a trial for these robberies, a person with no previous conviction should be sentenced to a period of imprisonment in the region of seven to seven and a half years. Such a sentence would be consistent with our suggested sentence for a category 2 robbery with the additional aggravating feature of the robbery taking place in the victim's home. 
 
 31. In our view, the appropriate sentence for all three offenders after a trial, given their individual aggravating circumstances, was in the region of eight to eight and a half years. The sentences of two years six months and two years nine months were unduly lenient. Taking into account the early pleas and reducing the sentences by a small amount to reflect the aspect of double jeopardy, we substitute sentences of five years' imprisonment concurrent for offenders 1 and 3 and five years' detention in a young offenders institution concurrent for offender 2.""

, Comment: sentence is excessive","Exact: as a result of inadequate advice they had been given by their legal team,

, Comment: nan","Exact: judge's approach was unlawful,

, Comment: nan","Exact: The judge also identified mitigating factors. In the case of the younger defendants, their age was such. For all defendants, he expressly found that he was prepared to proceed on the basis that there had not been an intention to kill, but rather an intention to do grievous harm, and death had resulted. For much the same reason he rejected significant premeditation as an additional aggravating factor.

, Comment: Judge did not balance mitigating factors correctly, e.g. young age of some of the offenders","Exact: The appeal was limited to the issues of whether there should have been a direction under s.240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), as amended by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”), and, if so, how many days spent on qualifying curfew and electronic monitoring conditions should count towards service of the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed upon the appellant in the Crown Court at Leicester on 13 December 2012.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The applicant’s counsel candidly accepted during mitigation before the learned judge that the pre-sentence report falsely purported to minimise his role and culpability, and he had little personal mitigation save for the support of his wife, a favourable report from the Prison Service and a reference from an employer. He is said to be a vulnerable man, who has had little education and is unable to read or write.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The safety of the conviction

, Comment: nan","Exact: The grounds of appeal advanced by Miss Smart, in helpful and succinct submissions both orally and in writing, focused on the judge's allowing Brown’s guilty plea to be admitted in evidence. Even if the plea was relevant and admissible under section 74, it was her contention it should have been excluded under section 78.

, Comment: guilty plea of co-accused should not have been admitted into evidence","Exact: that sentence to this court as unduly lenient

, Comment: nan","Exact: 24. Having reminded himself of the words of warning to be found in the authorities, the judge concluded, nonetheless, that he should withdraw the defence from the jury. So far as the immediacy issue is concerned, he reasoned that the time at which the applicant had first become a participant in the criminal conduct was when he agreed to sign for the parcel. At that time the threat in existence was not one which any properly directed jury could find was immediate or almost immediate. It was a conditional threat which would only ever be carried out at some future time. It was not enough to say that there was a threat that if the parcel was not signed for there would be immediate violence.

, Comment: Judge withdrew defence from the jury which should have been admitted","Exact: the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the prolonged course of incidents of serious cruelty, the presence of many high culpability factors relevant to count 2, the aggravating feature of the previous convictions, including previous domestic assaults, and the failure to seek medical treatment charged in count 3.  The combination of those features, he submits, should have resulted in a substantial adjustment above the guideline starting point for count 2, before considering the mitigating factors of remorse, mental health issues and personal mitigation.  Mr Lloyd adds that the offender should not have received full credit for his guilty pleas, which were not indicated at the first opportunity.  He submits that the total sentence was for those reasons unduly lenient.

, Comment: nan","Exact: judge had erred in concluding that this was a category B culpability case

, Comment: Sentencing judge should have put offence in a lower category of seriousness","Exact: erred by allowing the prosecution to cross-examine their own witnesses.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The question raised in this part of the appeal is whether there was power to extend the licence in the way that the judge did or whether that was unlawful as being a retrospective penalty and as such in breach of Art 7 (1) of the ECHR.

, Comment: nan","Exact: It was not a sustained attack in the sense envisaged by the guidelines and the harm was not so serious as to justify greater harm being found. This was, she submitted, a category 2 offence: lesser harm but greater culpability because of the use of the bottle. However, she submits that the bottle was not broken, although she recognised that it was used as a weapon.

, Comment: offence should be of lesser hard","Exact: The judge double-counted or took into account unjustified aggravating features

, Comment: nan","Exact: it is said that the applicant was not given credit for his guilty plea

, Comment: nan","Exact: the judge must have paid insufficient attention to the aggravating features which we have outlined

, Comment: nan","Exact: that sentence was manifestly excessive.

, Comment: nan","Exact: In so far as the pre-planning is concerned, it seems clear that the idea of robbing Bellamy had been formed earlier before the arrival on the beach. Additionally the offence of robbery continued over a considerable period of time.7.In so far as the listed mitigating factors are concerned, there was evidence of remorse in the appellant’s admissions to the police that he had been involved in the robbery. However, even in his basis of plea to the robbery Rafferty did not disclose his true involvement in the robbery as found by the jury. 8.We take the view that given all the aggravating features and in particular the fact that he committed this offence with Taylor, the sentence following a trial would be in the region of 10 years’ detention. Allowing for the plea of guilty we reduce that to seven years.

, Comment: offender had strong mitigation","Exact: sentence passed insufficiently allowed for the appellant's age and good character.

, Comment: nan","Exact: sentence was manifestly excessive and that the judge went behind the basis of plea which had not been challenged by the prosecution.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The directions to the jury omitted this ingredient

, Comment: directions to jury by judge omitted key clarification of the law","Exact: this was not the most serious case of its kind and that a starting point of four years and six months, which is close to the maximum of five years, was wrong in principle.

, Comment: nan","Exact: judge should have taken into account the fact that the appellant's time spent in custody from arrest to sentence as a result of his being recalled on licence would not be deducted from his sentence

, Comment: nan","Exact: evidence which the jury heard to the effect that this applicant had a conviction for assault against Simone Manning and had also been cautioned on three occasions, once for assault.

, Comment: evidence should not have been submitted to jury","Exact: The grounds of appeal focus on the decision of the trial judge to admit in evidence two matters. First, the discovery in a warehouse in Swansea of items associated with the processing or trafficking of controlled drugs, on which were found the fingerprints of this Applicant. Secondly, evidence of the conviction of the Applicant many years ago for an offence of being concerned in the importation of cannabis. The cannabis imported on that occasion came from South Africa by air, as did the cannabis which was the subject of this trial. The quantity of the earlier matter was, however, very much less than the quantity involved in the present case.

, Comment: judge admitted evidence of previous bad character/convictions that should not have been admitted","Exact: sentence of nine years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive.

, Comment: nan","Exact: judge's starting point of 10 years' imprisonment before credit for the guilty plea was too high since it indicated that before reduction for mitigating features the judge's starting position must in fact have been significantly in excess of 10 years.

, Comment: starting sentence was significantly excessive","Exact: unlawful and, in the absence of punishment, unduly lenient

, Comment: nan","Exact: a community punishment wholly failed to reflect the gravity of the offence and a custodial penalty was required.

, Comment: nan","Exact: first of all, the sentence on count 4 of 30 months' imprisonment is wrong in principle.

, Comment: sentence wrong in principal ","Exact: the order that the Appellant serve 455 days of the unexpired sentence imposed for the earlier offence was unexplained and failed to take into account the time he had spent in custody

, Comment: nan","Exact: The judge initially directed the jury inappropriately and in a way which it must have found very difficult to understand.

, Comment: nan","Exact: The principal ground of appeal is that the judge erred in admitting all of the 53 previous convictions of Mr White as ""non-defendant bad character"" evidence pursuant to section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

, Comment: judge should not have admitted evidence","Exact: arriving at a sentence of 15 years the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the youth of this appellant and, although reciting the background, failed to appreciate that there were cultural issues in play which must have imposed subtle pressure on the appellant to do something.

, Comment: judge did not account for mitigating factors correctly when sentencing","Exact: Disclosure was requested in the Defence Statement, which was provided late or not at all.

, Comment: sentence excessive as it would be expected to be imposed on an adult for such offence, not a 17 year old","Exact: sentence passed was manifestly excessive. He contended that insufficient account had been taken of the appellant's youth, the low level of his educational abilities and intelligence, his role as a follower rather than a leader and the fact that no approach of any kind had been shown to have been made to either the soldier to or to any of the other persons about whom enquiries had apparently been made.

, Comment: unlawful/unsafe conviction ","Exact: judge erred in finding the applicant to be dangerous within the meaning of section 279 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and, therefore, erred in imposing an extended term of sentence with the consequence that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

, Comment: Part of the conviction is quashed, the remaining conviction appeal is dismissed","Exact: we quash the minimum terms imposed by the judge. We substitute those terms to which we have just referred. The period spent on remand which the judge ordered to be set off against those terms will be set off against the fresh terms we have imposed. To that extent this appeal is allowed.

, Comment: Sentence is quashed and replaced with more lenient sentence","Exact: we grant leave to appeal.

, Comment: Allowed and sentence replaced with more lenient sentence","Exact: 11.In those circumstances we do not think there is anything like an arguable case that the whole process was unfair. It is apparent from the affidavit that the Applicants believe that they have been very unfairly dealt with. However their real complaint would appear to be with the rigour of the legislation and the way it was enforced by the Ministry. We do not think that the court process was unfair; indeed it could well be argued that they were extremely lucky that the Judge took the humane course that he did which led to the settlement.12.The Applicants also complain that much of the confiscation hearing was conducted by the Prosecution on a basis that was contrary to the basis of plea. Having considered the cases of Lazurus [2004] EWCA Crim 2297 and Lunnon [2005] 1 Cr. App. R.(S) 24, we are by no means satisfied that this is one of those cases where the Prosecution, by not contradicting a basis of plea, had bound itself in the Confiscation Proceedings. Further we are quite satisfied that, even if the Prosecution were so bound, that it did not render the proceedings unfair.

We do accept, having regard to the guideline, the youth and good character of the appellant and all of the points made on his behalf, that the sentence of nine years' detention in a young offender institution was too high.

, Comment: nan",,,,,,,,,"Exact: A legal error made in the formulation of charges, whether arising from a drafting or administrative error which causes no prejudice or embarrassment to the defendant, will not result in those charges being invalid or a nullity (see R v Stocker [2014] 1 Cr App R 18, at paragraphs 42 and 45) and R v Sheldrake [2023] EWCA Crim 95, at paragraph 16.  That notwithstanding, the judge in March 2019 had no power to revoke the SOPO, as indicated above.  An application to discharge a SOPO must, in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 31, be made by either the defendant or a Chief Officer of Police (see R v Hamer [2017] 2 Cr App R(S) 13 at paragraph 21; R v Ashford [2020] 2 Cr App R(S) 57 at paragraph 18 and also R v Keywood [2021] EWCA Crim 1692).  10.Copy link to this paragraphWe give leave.  We allow the appeal.  We quash the Order revoking the SOPO and the substitution of the Sexual Prevention Harm Order.  Therefore, the SOPO will be revived (see R v Keywood (supra)).  If appropriate, it will of course be open to a Chief Officer of Police or by the Director General of the National Crime Agency to make applications to the Magistrates’ Court for a Sexual Harm Prevention Order against a qualifying offender, who has acted in such as to give reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for such an Order to be made (see section 103A(3)-(7) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003).   To that extent, this appeal succeeds and we may therefore release Miss Greenhalgh and Mr Evans, but thanks for your attendance.

, Comment: Crown Court should not have revoked the SOPO and replace it with a SHPO",,,,,,,"Exact: As a result of the incompetent advice given by the duty solicitor, and more seriously by the solicitor who represented the appellant when he was before the Crown Court, the appellant spent time unnecessarily in prison. It has led to the cost of his detention in prison, the investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and the appearance of two counsel before us today. 15. It is unacceptable that such advice was given which plainly did not pass a standard of competence. It seems to us that people in the position of this appellant, and the system as a whole, are entitled to expect that those who advise in circumstances such as this should be familiar with the law. There can be little excuse for a failure to understand the law and advise properly. We therefore consider that this is a case where we should refer both the duty solicitor and the solicitor who represented the appellant at the hearing to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority for them to consider whether any proper sanction is to be taken against them.

, Comment: nan",,,,,,"Exact: The lack of premeditation was a factor, he submitted, which reduced culpability.  The driving was intended to cause fear rather than to cause harm; alternatively if it was category B, it was a less serious example of such an offence and therefore the judge's sentence was too high.  It was also submitted that the judge had paid insufficient regard to mitigating factors, namely the applicant's remorse, his suicide attempt whilst awaiting trial, and the gap of 8 years between these offences and the applicant's previous offending.  The decision to make the burglary sentence consecutive also made the total sentence manifestly excessive.

, Comment: gap of 8 years between previous offences",,,,,"Exact: sentence of two years did not reflect the absence of a number of aggravating circumstances and laid too much emphasis on aggravating circumstances which were not, on proper analysis, such.

, Comment: sentence is too excessive ",,,,"Exact: manifestly excessive,

, Comment: excessive sentence when compared to co-offenders","Exact: that the applicant's involvement was limited to a period of 12 days; that there was no suggestion that she had personally inflicted or witnessed the inflicting of any of the injuries; that she had made some efforts to assist Jacob; and that the visible injuries to him did not alert her to the very serious underlying brain injuries which Jacob was suffering.

, Comment: appeal court believes.offender has strong personal mitigation",,,,"Exact: a sentence of 33 months was too long for this offence. He submits, quite correctly, that the appellant was entitled to full credit for his plea of guilty and that being so he submits that the judge's starting point for his sentence was a sentence after trial in excess of four years. Counsel submits that although this was a serious offence, on any view, it was not such so as to attract a sentence which is quite close to the maximum available.

, Comment: excessive sentence as mitigating factors not considered","Exact: Even if the offending fell into category 1, he says, it was at the lower part of the scale. He argues that the only indicator of greater harm was that the victim was at home and was moved around during the search. He argues that too much emphasis was placed on this. The burglary was committed over a relatively brief period during which the intruders were plainly more interested in finding something, rather than in the victim.

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: here was positive evidence of the appellant's good behaviour in supporting Michaela and the other children. The offence was not premeditated and took place, as we have said, in a very short space of time. This appellant had not been in trouble for offences such as this before. Not only was he only 23 at the time of his trial, he unfortunately suffered from limited intelligence amounting to a borderline learning disability. He had sought immediate help for the child as soon as he had shaken her in a way to cause her death. Against that, it has to be said that this was a very young girl of two who required the protection of the courts. The impact on the family, as we have said, was devastating and will continue to be.

, Comment: strong personal mitigation","Exact: In so far as the pre-planning is concerned, it seems clear that the idea of robbing Bellamy had been formed earlier before the arrival on the beach. Additionally the offence of robbery continued over a considerable period of time.7.In so far as the listed mitigating factors are concerned, there was evidence of remorse in the appellant’s admissions to the police that he had been involved in the robbery. However, even in his basis of plea to the robbery Rafferty did not disclose his true involvement in the robbery as found by the jury. 8.We take the view that given all the aggravating features and in particular the fact that he committed this offence with Taylor, the sentence following a trial would be in the region of 10 years’ detention. Allowing for the plea of guilty we reduce that to seven years.

They included that this may have been a case where there would not have been an accident at all but for the unknown defect in the vehicle, namely the slow puncture, of which the appellant was unaware.  There was also the remorse shown by the appellant, the fact that those killed were his close friends, which the Guideline says specifically at paragraph 23 may be a mitigating factor, together with his good driving record and his previous good character.

, Comment: sentence excessive as it would be expected to be imposed on an adult for such offence, not a 17 year old","Exact: sentence passed was manifestly excessive. He contended that insufficient account had been taken of the appellant's youth, the low level of his educational abilities and intelligence, his role as a follower rather than a leader and the fact that no approach of any kind had been shown to have been made to either the soldier to or to any of the other persons about whom enquiries had apparently been made.

As a result of his injuries he now has limited mobility in both legs, needing a stick to walk even for short distances, and he has lost the use of his left arm and hand. He lives in sheltered accommodation and requires special equipment and adaptations to assist with his daily living.

, Comment: offender has personal mitigations which make the sentence excessive",,-,"Exact: 15. It is further argued that the judge was wrong to reject a submission that there had been an element of provocation, which provided some mitigation for the offences of violence. In this regard, counsel pointed to evidence that there had been an incident earlier that day in which Kudriasov had been injured. They argued, in the alternative, in their respective written grounds, that the judge should have found some mitigation in evidence suggesting that there may have been some kind of drugs background to the attack on Messrs Kaleckas and Likso.16. Turning to personal mitigation, both appellants submit that the judge, although he specifically referred in his sentencing remarks to the appellants' previous good character, or effective good character, failed to give sufficient weight to that aspect of the case. Counsel pray in aid that both appellants are hard-working men with family responsibilities, and that both have behaved well and made good use of their time in custody whilst on remand awaiting trial.17. Next, specific submissions are made on behalf of the appellant Apsitis to the effect that his inability to speak or read English will mean that time in custody will be harder for him than for most other prisoners. It is also submitted on his behalf that the judge should have given some weight to the fact that Apsitis had always admitted presence, and that at a plea and case management hearing he had admitted guilt of an offence of unlawful wounding.18. On behalf of the appellant Kudriasov, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that he may well have brought a golf club to the scene. It is, however, realistically acknowledged that, whether he did or not, he was part of a group who were collectively armed.19. For those various reasons counsel submit that the total sentences of 18 years' imprisonment were manifestly excessive in length.

, Comment: nan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Exact: . He reminded himself of the guideline that the sentence of three and a half years' detention was already ""below the suggested range"". He then returned to address the fact, amply established, that none of the guidelines constitute straitjackets and that judges should have the courage to depart from guidelines where it was right to do so. Addressing the facts of the case he said:
 
  
  
 ""The medical evidence shows that there was penetration, that there was ejaculation; but as I have thought about the case, the more incredible it seems to me to be that there could have been anything beginning to approach a normal act of intercourse on your part without her waking. By 'normal' I do not of course include 'consensual'. Whatever happened must have been very brief.""
 
 18. The judge then examined the guideline which suggests the approach to be taken by sentencing judges where there has been penetration other than by the penis. Having reflected on these matters and considered the offender's culpability he came to the conclusion that no real harm was caused and therefore, in accordance with section 143 and 153(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the shortest sentence possible must be passed and the sentence would therefore be one of two years' detention.

, Comment: nan",,,,,,,,"Exact: 12. We find nothing exceptional about the offender's apparent unwillingness to possess the gun. The judge was entitled to make the finding of unwillingness, but it is often the case that young men and women of apparently good character are persuaded, cajoled, encouraged and sometimes pressurised into carrying, or holding, or looking after these lethal weapons. They are chosen for that purpose because it is unlikely that the police will have any interest in them, and so those who own the weapons can keep them safe and secure. The offender knew what he was doing. We find nothing in his evidence to suggest that he was under duress. Nor do we find anything in the evidence to suggest that he provided information on the kind of scale which would have enabled the police to hunt down and identify the men who had provided the weapon. We are also deeply concerned that the fact that the car in which the gun was found was used by the offender's mother and sister was treated as a mitigating factor. On one view it is an aggravating feature, if for no other reason than it might have implicated his mother and sister.

, Comment: judge did not weight the aggravating features correctly",,,"Exact: The starting point for a category 2 offence is a term of 6 years' imprisonment but these two factors, as well as the location and timing of the offence, the commission of the offence while drunk and the continuing effect of the crime on the victim, would have elevated the starting point.

, Comment: Judge was right to admit the evidence ",,,"Exact: that it did not render the proceedings unfair.

, Comment: Proceedings were not unfair",,,,"Exact: Gordon Smith’s application was refused at an earlier hearing by a different Division of this court.

, Comment: Don't know","Exact: he judge took the correct starting point of 15 years. The concealment of the body in such a way that it has never been found and the fact that his wife was pregnant to his knowledge when he murdered her are both seriously aggravating factors that justified the significant increase above the minimum term.

, Comment: judge sentencing was correct","Exact: The evidence was overwhelming: the incident was captured on CCTV and the appellant admitted punching Mr Luck for no obvious reason and when he was under no real threat. Further, the idea that Mr Luck would have been prepared to pay £250 for spilling water on the appellant’s hoodie and would have willingly left his credit card and pin number behind or that the appellant could have thought, even in drink, that he was entitled to £250 for a wet hoodie, stretches credulity to breaking point. The defence, as the prosecution at trial argued, bears all the hallmarks of the appellant having fabricated a story to meet the objectively verifiable facts, namely the appellant’s aggressive behaviour caught on camera and the withdrawals and attempted withdrawals from Mr Luck’s bank account. We doubt the jury would have placed any great reliance on Brown's plea, they could see for themselves the circumstances in which Mr Luck's money and card were taken.

, Comment: conviction was not unsafe",,"Exact: The judge stayed firmly on the right side of the line between usurping the role of the jury and the proper exercise of the judicial function.

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: approach taken by the Judge did not result in an overall sentence which is arguably manifestly excessive.""

, Comment: sentencing by judge was correct","Exact: do not in fact make an arguable case that the conviction was unsafe.

, Comment: conviction was not unsafe","Exact: Had the court in that case been provided with the information that we have had, we have no doubt they would have come to the same conclusion as we do.

, Comment: nan","Exact: the sentences of 3 years and 2 years are entirely appropriate

, Comment: sentence not excessive","Exact: conviction is not arguably unsafe

, Comment: nan",,-,"Exact: . It cannot possibly be said that the sentence imposed by the judge was in any way excessive or failed to have due regard to all the mitigation available.

, Comment: sentence was not excessive and was justified","Exact: judge properly came to the decision that the material relied on did not satisfy the necessary evidential test. The mere fact that a complaint is raised and is not pursued does not necessarily mean that a complaint is false. Courts should be ready to deploy a degree of understanding of the position of those who have made sexual allegations. Failure to pursue the complaint does not of necessity show that it is untrue. A rather closer examination of the circumstances is required.

, Comment: judge made correct ruling ",,"Exact: there is no real prospect of appellate interference with the judge's overall evaluative assessments of the individual roles and culpability of those involved, or the resulting sentence on the applicant that he imposed.

, Comment: no basis for appeal","Exact: There is no arguable basis on which it can be said that the total sentence was manifestly excessive

, Comment: nan","Exact: we conclude that the conviction of Mr Kelleher is to be regarded as ""safe"".

, Comment: conviction was not unsafe","Exact: We therefore conclude that there is no substance in any of the grounds of appeal against conviction which have been drawn to our attention, and the appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.

, Comment: nan",,,,,"Exact: We do not consider that his ruling is one which can be impugned as wrong in the way contended for. He had a difficult ruling to make, but it was one which was properly open to him in all the circumstances. We therefore grant leave to appeal in relation to conviction as the matter was plainly arguable, but we dismiss the appeal.

, Comment: judge was not prejudiced and conviction was not unsafe",,"Exact: we do not accept that the figure of 2 years determined by the judge was outside the appropriate range.

, Comment: nan","Exact: We have considered this point with care. Our conclusion is that the learned judge made a reduction from the notional adult sentence which was in accordance with the guideline. Had there been but a single offence it might have been appropriate to make a rather greater reduction. But, as we have said, the judge here was passing concurrent sentences to reflect more than one offence of oral rape.

, Comment: nan","Exact: impossible to say that on the facts of this case it is arguable that a sentence of 32 months in all was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.

, Comment: Trial/sentencing judge considered all relevant facts in appropriate way and came to correct conclusion/decision","Exact: This argument ignores the terrifying nature of the victim's ordeal and its consequences, which justified the judge's view that this was a Category 1 case. The alternative submission that even if the offending fell into Category 1, the starting point should be in the lower part is hopeless, as the judge's careful analysis makes plain. Indeed, it was generous to allow a reduction of 1 year to reflect progress in prison over a few months prior to sentence.

, Comment: judge correctly categorised offence and appellant's role in the offence",-,"Exact: We are satisfied that for the reason set out in the previous paragraph the proper exercise of the judge’s discretion would have been to take no account of the payment made by Vaclensa to the Commissioners after the discovery of the fraud.

, Comment: Trial/sentencing judge considered all relevant facts in appropriate way and came to correct conclusion/decision",,"Exact: Neither conviction is unsafe.

, Comment: nan","Exact: we consider that this verdict was entirely safe

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: We do not consider that this ground erects an arguable error sufficient to render the verdict on this count unsafe.

, Comment: conviction was not unsafe","Exact: What the judge said in his summing-up about it was entirely accurate.

, Comment: nan","Exact: However, in the circumstances we have described, we do not regard it as unduly lenient.

, Comment: nan","Exact: He correctly identified the many aggravating features, as well as being careful not to double count for the features that were intrinsic to the offences themselves.

, Comment: judge correctly identified aggravating factors","Exact: The co-defendants received lesser sentences because their roles were less significant and therefore their culpability was lower.  Of the defendants before the court, it was only the applicant who played a leading role.  It was therefore inevitable that he would receive a longer term of imprisonment.

, Comment: nan",,,,,,,"Exact: sentence and disqualification were not manifestly excessive and this renewed application is refused.

, Comment: nan","Exact: there has been no substantial prejudice caused to the applicant we decline to grant an extension of time since it has not been shown that one is necessary to cure a substantial injustice.

, Comment: nan",,,,"Exact: We do not agree that the sentence can properly be described as manifestly excessive.  It was an appropriate sentence for this attempted murder.

, Comment: nan","Exact: here is nothing in this which could potentially affect the safety of the conviction.

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: it is not, even arguably, a manifestly excessive sentence.

, Comment: judge correctly weight aggravating and mitigating factors","Exact: while the sentence may have been a severe one, in our view it was justifiably so.

, Comment: the 'severe' sentence was justified by the offence which was committed","Exact: the judge took into account all the relevant factors, including the appellant's limited intelligence, and passed a sentence that was, in our judgment, within the range that was appropriate in all the circumstances. In our view, the sentence passed by the judge certainly cannot properly be stigmatised as manifestly excessive.

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: it cannot be properly described as manifestly excessive.

, Comment: nan","Exact: here was nothing wrong with the credit given to this applicant

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: There are no arguable grounds to interfere with the judge's assessment of dangerousness

, Comment: nan",,"Exact: but in our view the judge adequately took these into account in imposing the sentence that he did. We note in addition that the prison reports available to us today refer to the fact that the applicant's mobility problems have not prevented him from engaging in a variety of prison activities and courses, which have been of real benefit to him. In our judgment this sentence cannot arguably be said to be manifestly excessive or wrong in principle and we therefore refuse leave to appeal.

, Comment: sentencing judge imposed the correct sentence considering the seriousness of the offence","Exact: The issue in this case was not precisely what had happened, nor was there the issue as to whether or not there had been a sexual encounter, the only issue was consent. So far as that is concerned, the evidence, in our judgment, was overwhelming. In those circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.

, Comment: judge did fail to summarise correctly and instruct the jury, but the conviction is still safe as the question was about consent",-,,"Exact: There were significant aggravating features, which required an upward adjustment from the starting point, and in circumstances in which the appellant was on bail when he committed the offence in the second indictment, consecutive sentencing was justified.
