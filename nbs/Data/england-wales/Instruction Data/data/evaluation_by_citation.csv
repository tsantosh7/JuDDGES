COMMENT: nan","EXACT: 1. This is an application by the prosecution for leave to appeal against a terminating ruling under section 58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The ruling in question was made by Mr Recorder Owen Davies QC at the Harrow Crown Court on 30 August 2007. The respondent faced his trial before the Recorder on an indictment containing a single count which alleged an offence of having in his possession an offensive weapon, namely ""a pair of sand gloves"". At the end of the prosecution evidence the Recorder of his own motion stopped the case, holding that the gloves in question were not in law capable of being regarded as an offensive weapon within the meaning of the relevant statute, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. This is the ruling which the Crown seeks to appeal. The application is brought under section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

The issue concerns whether admitted breaches by the police of Code of Practice D, issued under the\nPolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984\n(“PACE”), on recognition evidence, were such that the evidence should have been excluded by the trial judge and render the convictions unsafe.\n\n2.\nOn 22 November 2022 in the Crown Court at Newcastle Upon Tyne the Appellant was convicted of three offences:  robbery (Count 1), possession of a bladed article (Count 2) and driving whilst disqualified (Count 3).  On 6 February 2023 he was sentenced by HHJ Bindloss to a total sentence of 78 months’ imprisonment, which was the sentence on Count 1, with the other sentences being made concurrent.  Other appropriate orders were made, including an order that the Appellant be disqualified from driving for 51 months.\n\n3.\nThere were two co-defendants who were also charged with robbery (Count 1).  Leanne Craggs pleaded guilty to that charge on the first day of the trial.  Ryan Neil was acquitted of that charge on the direction of the judge, following a submission of no case to answer.\n\n4.\nJohn Hogg was a delivery driver for WH Smiths.  On the morning of Sunday 15 May 2022 he was making deliveries to shops in the South Tyneside area.  At about 5am Mr Hogg stopped his Renault van to make a delivery of newspapers to a One Stop Shop.  Just before he stopped he had noticed a Nissan Juke car travelling behind him.  He said he saw a man get out and then get back in the front passenger seat, and he described the car as coming very close behind his van before backing off\n.\n\n5.\nAt the One Stop Shop Mr Hogg exited his van to deliver some newspapers.  As he did this he heard someone open the Renault van driver’s side door.  He returned to the van and was threatened by a male armed with a knife.  The male wore a plastic mask and said to Mr Hogg, “Fuck off before you get chopped up”.  The male stole the van, valued around £25,000, which had on board about £3,000 to £4,000 worth of newspapers.  The Renault van and Nissan Juke were driven away from the scene in convoy\n,\nand Mr Hogg immediately reported the matter to police.  The robbery was captured on CCTV although the footage only showed the robber from behind\n.\n\n6.\nAt 8.35am on 15 May the Nissan Juke was stopped by police. Leanne Craggs was the driver and Ryan Neil was the front seat passenger\n.\nLeanne Craggs’ home address was searched and a number of newspapers, along with two rubber face masks were found.  Leanne Craggs’ fingerprints were discovered on the newspapers.  Leanne Craggs’ and Ryan Neil’s DNA was present on the face masks.  Mr Hogg confirmed that the masks were the same as the one worn by the robber\n.\n\n7.\nDC Arthur and DC Sengelow were assigned to investigate the robbery when they began work on Monday, 16 May 2022.  Both officers interviewed Leanne Craggs at 5.37pm on that date.  The interview led DC Arthur to go to a Morrison’s petrol station on 18 May to make further enquiries\n.\n\n8.\nAt the petrol station DC Arthur located some CCTV footage.  It showed that around four hours before the robbery, at 1.13am on 15 May, Leanne Craggs had been at the petrol station with the Nissan Juke and a number of other people.  In evidence DC Arthur said that he suspected one of the others to be the Appellant\n.\nHe had never dealt with the Appellant in the flesh but had seen him from behind and also in photos.  He said that he was 90 to 95 per cent certain that the person in the footage was the Appellant\n.\n\n9.\nDC Arthur said that he returned to the police station, where he told his investigation team of what he had seen and that it was his belief that the Appellant was a male in the footage.  The investigation team included DC Sengelow\n.\n\n10.\nOn 20 May 2022 DC Sengelow attended the petrol station with DC Arthur to view the footage.  He identified one of the males present on the footage as the Appellant.  In evidence he said that he had previously dealt with the Appellant face to face on two occasions in 2019, as well as seeing him in photos\n.\n\n11.\nDC Sengelow said he downloaded the petrol station footage onto a USB stick and returned to the police station, where he reviewed the footage.  He created still images from the footage.  However, by the time of the trial, some of the moving footage that gave rise to the still images from 1.13am at the petrol station had been lost\n.\n\n12.\nThe prosecution case at trial was that the man in the petrol station footage at 1.13am was the Appellant.  Because of his distinctive clothing and the link to the Nissan Juke, the prosecution said that the Appellant was the same man seen in the footage at 5am robbing Mr Hogg at knife point\n.\n\n13.\nThe defence case was\nthat the male at the petrol station at around 1am was not the Appellant, and he had been wrongly identified by police. It was his case that the Appellant was not the person shown on the CCTV footage carrying out the robbery\n.\n\n14.\nWhen the Appellant was interviewed he made no comment.  He did not give evidence at trial\n.\n\n15.\nThe issue for the jury was whether they were sure that the man seen in the distinctive clothing in the petrol station at around 1.13am was the Appellant.  If they were sure that he was, they also had to be sure that he was the man seen in the later footage robbing Mr Hogg.\n\n16.\nThe relevant code of practice under PACE is Code D on the identification of persons by police officers, which had effect from 23 February 2017\n.\n\n17.\nPart (b) of the Code is concerned with “Recognition by controlled showing of films, photographs and images”.  Paragraph D:3.34 explains that this part of this section applies when, for the purposes of obtaining evidence of recognition, arrangements are made for a person, including a police officer, who is\nnot\nan eye-witness:  (a) to view a film, photograph or any other visual medium; and (b) on the occasion of the viewing, to be asked whether they recognise anyone whose image is shown in the material as someone who is known to them\n.\n\n18.\nParagraph D:3.35 provides as follows:\n“To provide safeguards against mistaken recognition and to avoid any possibility of collusion, on the occasion of the viewing, the arrangements should ensure:\n(a)\nthat the films, photographs and other images are shown on an individual basis;\n(b)\nthat any person who views the material:\n(i)\nis unable to communicate with any other individual to whom the material has been, or is to be, shown;\n(ii)\nis not reminded of any photograph or description of any individual whose image is shown or given any other indication as to the identity of any such individual;\n(iii)\nis not to be told whether a previous witness has recognised any one;\n(c)\nthat immediately before a person views the material, they are told that:\n(i)\nan individual who is known to them may, or may not, appear in the material they are shown and that if they do not recognise anyone, they should say so;\n(ii)\nat any point, they may ask to see a particular part of the material frozen for them to study and there is no limit on how many times they can view the whole or any part or parts of the material; and\n(d)\nthat the person who views the material is not asked to make any decision as to whether they recognise anyone whose image they have seen as someone known to them until they have seen the whole of the material at least twice, unless the officer in charge of the viewing decides that because of the number of images the person has been invited to view, it would not be reasonable to ask them to view the whole of the material for a second time.  A record of this decision must be included in the record that is made in accordance with paragraph 3:36\n.\n\n19.\nParagraph D:3.36 provides as follows:\n“A record of the circumstances and conditions under which the person is given an opportunity to recognise an individual must be made and the record must include:\n(a)\nwhether the person knew or was given information concerning the name or identity of any suspect;\n(b)\nwhat the person has been told\nbefore\nthe viewing about the offence, the person(s) depicted in the images or the offender and by whom;\n(c)\nhow and by whom the witness has asked to view the image or look at the individual;\n(d)\nwhether the viewing was alone or with others and if with others, the reason for it;\n(e)\nthe arrangements under which the person viewed the film or saw the individual and by whom those arrangements were made;\n(f)\nsubject to paragraph 2.18, the name and rank of the officer responsible for deciding that the viewing arrangements should be made in accordance with this Part;\n(g)\nthe date time and place images were viewed or further viewed or the individual was seen;\n(h)\nthe times between which the images were viewed or the individual was seen;\n(i)\nhow the viewing of images or sighting of the individual was controlled and by whom;\n(j)\nwhether the person was familiar with the location shown in any images or the place where they saw the individual and if so, why;\n(k)\nwhether or not, on this occasion, the person claims to recognise any image shown, or any individual seen, as being someone know to them, and if they do:\n(i)\nthe reason;\n(ii)\nthe words of recognition;\n(iii)\nany expression of doubt; and\n(iv)\nwhat features of the image or the individual triggered the recognition\n.\n\n20.\nThe defence argued that the identification evidence of DC Arthur and DC Sengelow was inadmissible and ought to be excluded under section 78 of PACE.  It was also argued that the still images taken from CCTV footage which was subsequently lost were inadmissible under section 78\n.\n\n21.\nA\nvoir dire\ntook place between 10 and 15 November before HHJ Bindloss, at which both DC Arthur and DC Sengelow gave evidence.  On the main issue before him, the Judge ruled\nthat:\n“… I have come to the view that, notwithstanding the failures to satisfy Code D3.36 on the day of the viewing, this is no mere bald assertion by these two police officers, nor is the recognition evidence inherently poor. On the information that has come to light since, the jury will have plenty of material available to them to be able to assess the accuracy, or otherwise, of the police officers’ recognition evidence. There is material to test what the police officers are saying. There is material open to Miss Hall [counsel for the defence] to cross-examine the police officers about their recognition. In addition, the jury will have the original footage and the stills, and they can compare those directly to the defendant themselves”\n.\n\n22.\nIn reaching that decision the Judge applied the recent decision of this Court in\nR v Yaryare and Others\n[2020] EWCA Crim 1314\n;\n[2020] 4 WLR 156\n.\n\n23.\nThe Judge also rejected the submission that the stills should not be admitted in evidence given that the footage from which they had been taken had been lost.  In reaching that decision the Judge applied the decision of the Divisional Court in\nR (Ebrahim) v Feltham Magistrates’ Court\n[2001] EWHC 130 (Admin)\n;\n[2001] 1 WLR 1293\n.\n\n24.\nFollowing the close of the prosecution case, counsel for the defence submitted that there was no case for the Appellant to answer, on the basis that the recognition evidence was poor and there was no supporting evidence before the jury.  The Judge ruled that:\n“I have come to the view that this recognition evidence is reasonably good. It is certainly sufficient to go before the jury.  In addition, the jury have the CCTV images and the stills [so] that they can make their own comparison.\nAlthough there are a number of weaknesses, those are a matter for the jury to consider. I have looked at the trial compendium and reminded myself of the direction that should be given in recognition evidence cases like this and it lists a number of bullet points setting out the weaknesses, if there are any, and that … they should be identified for the jury and the jury should be told to keep those in mind when assessing whether a recognition is reliable or not and it is clear to me that this is one of those classic cases.\nThe police -- two police officers have purported to recognise.  The jury must make their own assessment of that.  I have a duty to point out the weaknesses and direct the jury to be cautious, and I will, and the jury can safely be left, properly directed, to consider this evidence and applying the second limb in\nGalbraith\n, reminded myself [\n sic\n] that this is an ID case and the additional factors in\nTurnbull\nshould be carefully considered.  In my judgment, a jury properly directed could safely convict Mr Bogie and Miss Hall’s submission fails”

COMMENT: nan","EXACT: The Vice President: 1. On 17th July 2003 at a Naval Court Martial held at HMS Drake (Commander Williams sitting as Judge Advocate) the applicant was found guilty of using violence to a superior officer contrary to s11 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 and was sentenced to be kept in detention for 36 days and to suffer the consequential penalties involved.... Before addressing these questions in turn, it is pertinent to record certain matters of history. The defendant in Grieves was tried by a naval court martial in June 1998. In April 2003, that is after his trial but prior to the appellant’s trial, QRRN 3630 came into force.... The Vice President: 6. Furthermore, as from the date of the judgment in Grieves, the policy whereby uniformed Judge Advocates were appointed has been terminated. Since that time the Judge Advocate at all naval courts martial has been a civilian judge chosen by the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, a civilian Circuit Judge. On 16th January 2004, to regularise the manner of appointment, there came into force the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (Remedial) Order 2004, made in response to the judgment in Grieves.... The Vice President: 8. The first question which arises on this appeal is whether this court should regard the conclusions of the European Court of Human Rights in Grieves as being applicable to the appellant. This court is not bound by that decision but must, in accordance with s2(1) of the Human Rights Act, take it into account.... The Vice President: 12. In our judgment it is not appropriate to seek to construe the judgment in Grieves as if it were a statute. Whatever comments can be made in relation to the detail of the court’s reasoning, the leitmotif of the judgment repeatedly shines out from paragraphs 82,85,87,89 and 91. This is that that naval court-martial was unfair because the pivotal role of the Naval Judge Advocate was performed by a serving naval officer not a civilian; in consequence, the most significant guarantee of independence in other courts martial was missing; and the applicant’s misgivings about independence and impartiality were objectively justified. These considerations apply equally in the case of the appellant. His trial was unfair in breach of his Article 6 rights because the Judge Advocate was a serving naval officer as well as because he was appointed by the Chief Naval Judge Advocate, another serving naval officer.

The offences dated back to the period 1985 to 1997 and were, therefore, properly charged as indecent assault, contrary to section 15 (1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (“the 1956 Act”). The appellant was prosecuted. However, during the first trial in July 2011, another young man E disclosed an allegation of anal rape. The jury was discharged and an investigation ensued. E claimed the rape occurred on New Year’s Day 2008 and the Appellant was, therefore, charged with rape contrary to section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”).

COMMENT: 5-17","EXACT: Counts 1 and 2 alleged that JH\'s father had indecently assaulted her when she was aged 4 or 5. She described two incidents, both of which took place in her parents\' bedroom. In respect of the second allegation, her witness statement contained a detailed narrative account of how her father had touched her vagina, then inserted his finger into it and then progressed to kissing it. Counts 3, 4 and 5 all alleged rape when JH was between the ages of 8 and 10. In her statement, she gave very detailed narrative accounts of three specific incidents of sexual intercourse, one of which took place in her parents\' bedroom, one at her grandparents\' house and one at her father\'s place of work. In respect of counts 1 to 5, the detailed accounts in the police statement were not adduced in evidence. There was no real inconsistency between what JH said in evidence and what she had said in her witness statement. No doubt counsel for H would not have wished to explore the detail given in the statement as there would have been a danger that the detail would have been accurately repeated and would have impressed and convinced the jury.\n\nIn respect of count 6, JH described in her statement how, when she was about 10, her father took her to a room in a building to which she had never been before. There she saw four men whom she did not know. She gave a detailed description of the layout of the room and the furniture. She also described each man and his clothing, in two cases descending into some detail. She then described, again in detail, how her father had had intercourse with her in the presence of the four men and how, after that, her father had forced her to have oral sex with him, had ejaculated into her mouth and had told her to swallow. The men watching were laughing. She then described how she was touched by some of the other men and had to masturbate one of them.\n\nIn evidence her account differed in two important respects from her previous statement. She said that she had not had to have oral sex with her father and had no recollection of ejaculate in her mouth. Also she added an allegation that the other men had inserted objects into her vagina, which had not previously been mentioned.\n\nIn respect of that count, JH was cross-examined closely about the differences between her police statement and her evidence, and, as we have said, H was acquitted on that count.\n\nIn respect of the seventh count, JH said that on numerous occasions up to the age of about 11 her father would rape her in his bedroom at home. She described what would usually happen on such occasions. She said that intercourse then ceased, but that inappropriate, sometimes indecent, touching continued until she was about 17.

COMMENT: nan","EXACT: The writer of the pre-sentence report noted that the appellant, at first, had difficulty accepting that he had committed the offences although he later acknowledged his guilt. He gave a vague explanation of feeling low at the time, but denied that he had sexual interest in children. He demonstrated difficulty in accepting responsibility. The writer considered that the risk of reconviction was medium and noted that social services had said that he was not allowed to have any unsupervised or face-to-face contact with his own daughter.

COMMENT: Dismissed-Failed","EXACT: nan
COMMENT: nan","EXACT: We have concluded that the expert evidence upon which the appellant relied in 2012 was both relevant and of some probative importance to the issues considered by the jury in Reading in 2007. The jury in the 2007 trial was very much concerned with the issue of interpretation of the appellant’s alleged conduct, partly admitted and partly denied. It was to that issue that the expert evidence was primarily, although not exclusively, relevant. We cannot conclude that the decisions made by the jury in 2007 would undoubtedly have survived their consideration of the new evidence admitted in the appeal under section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. For this reason we take the view that the verdicts were unsafe and must be quashed.

We do accept, having regard to the guideline, the youth and good character of the appellant and all of the points made on his behalf, that the sentence of nine years' detention in a young offender institution was too high.

COMMENT: nan","EXACT: In our judgment, that submission is well-founded. This sentence it is not of such leniency as can be categorised as unduly so. We add one footnote: Mr Heywood properly draws our attention to sections 26 and 28 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, which imposed a duty on the judge to consider, which he did not do, whether or not it was appropriate to make an order disqualifying the offender from working with children. There is, where an offence has been committed against a child an obligation to make such an order of disqualification, unless the judge takes the view that it is unlikely that the offender will commit an offence against a child in the future. We mention that matter because it is a statutory provision to which sentencers ought to pay appropriate regard. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, we accept Miss Davies' submission that, the judge, had he considered it, would almost certainly have concluded that it was unlikely that this offender would commit offences against children in the future. We say that having regard to the fact that he had desisted from this conduct in the circumstances to which we have referred, and because there was nothing in his record to suggest that he was in any way a menace to children. Having regard to all the circumstances, we decline to interfere with the sentence passed by the learned judge.

The judge was entitled to make the finding of unwillingness, but it is often the case that young men and women of apparently good character are persuaded, cajoled, encouraged and sometimes pressurised into carrying, or holding, or looking after these lethal weapons. They are chosen for that purpose because it is unlikely that the police will have any interest in them, and so those who own the weapons can keep them safe and secure. The offender knew what he was doing. We find nothing in his evidence to suggest that he was under duress. Nor do we find anything in the evidence to suggest that he provided information on the kind of scale which would have enabled the police to hunt down and identify the men who had provided the weapon. We are also deeply concerned that the fact that the car in which the gun was found was used by the offender's mother and sister was treated as a mitigating factor. On one view it is an aggravating feature, if for no other reason than it might have implicated his mother and sister.
