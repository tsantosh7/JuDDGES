1.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT BAKER: The Attorney-General seeks leave to refer a sentence of 30 months' imprisonment imposed on Owen Anthony Myrie to this court as unduly lenient. We grant that leave.
2.
The offender, Myrie, is aged 39 and pleaded guilty in the Crown Court at Croydon to a single count of arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, contrary to
section 1
of the
Criminal Damage Act 1971
. The sentence was imposed by Her Honour Judge Downing.
3.
The facts of the case are these. In the early hours of Saturday 14 June 2008 the offender started a fire at the address of a man called Norbert John. The offender poured a flammable liquid, probably petrol, onto the outside of the house, including on the front door and then lit the liquid and a mattress located below the living room window. He then lit the area with a naked flame. A neighbour saw the resulting fire and managed to raise the alarm, waking Mr John and his family, thereby enabling them to leave the house safely. There were two children in the house and the neighbours fortunately were able to get them out as well.
4.
The fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, preventing it from spreading to the inside of the house. The offender committed the offence as an act of revenge following an altercation with Mr John a few hours before.
5.
In a little more detail, what happened was this. At about 9 o'clock on the previous evening, Friday 13 June, the offender, who was driving a white van, was involved in a minor road traffic accident near Croydon with a car driven by Mr John. Matters became heated by the roadside. The offender produced a baseball bat. Mr John took out a Stanley knife from his car and the two men became involved in a scuffle. The offender it seems received an injury which caused some bleeding and Mr John then drove away from the immediate scene. The police arrived and spoke to the offender. A second police unit found and spoke to Mr John, who was still in the vicinity of the incident. The police decided to treat the incident as a damage only accident and for the purpose of facilitating insurance claims ensured that the details of the parties were exchanged. It was by this means that the offender obtained details of Mr John's address in Selsdon. On receipt of the information the offender told a police officer: ""I'm telling you I'm going to get my revenge for this."" The officer warned him against doing anything stupid.
6.
Later that night, at some time after 1 o'clock the following morning, a neighbour of Mr John's heard a loud explosion and the sound of breaking glass. He looked and saw flames at the door of Mr John's mid terraced house. He went to the house and raised the alarm, banging and shouting for the occupants to get out. Inside were Mr John and his wife who were asleep on the sofa in the living room and their two children aged seven and 15. The alarm woke Mr John. He looked out of the window and saw flames at the front of his house. The children were taken outside to safety and Mr John and his wife also left.
7.
Mr John went outside and by throwing buckets of water over the flames managed to extinguish the fire at the front door. At that moment the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire at the window. It was noticed that there was a strong smell of petrol at the front of the house. Officers spoke to a number of witnesses and established that a man had been seen running from the front door and then driving off in a white van.
8.
A fire investigator visited the scene later in order to establish the cause of the fire. She found that the damage, which was estimated at some £7,000, included substantial damage to the front door and that the charring was confined to the outside of the house. She concluded that the fire had been started by the introduction of a flammable liquid to the outside of the house and combustible material, namely the mattress below the living room window. The area had then been ignited with a naked flame. The mattress had been left outside by Mr John some time before.
9.
On the afternoon of 14th June the offender was arrested. He was asked about his van. On looking outside he said it was not in the street where he had left it and it must have been stolen. However, the police found a set of keys in the offender's possession and shortly afterwards the van was found parked nearby. When the doors were opened there was a strong smell of petrol immediately apparent. A carton containing what appeared to be petrol was found in the back.
10.
The offender was interviewed under caution. He denied the offence and was charged on 15th June.
11.
He has a previous conviction for handling stolen goods, in 1989, and three road traffic offences, for which he received fines in total of around £250. For sentencing purposes, he was a man of previous good character.
12.
The pre-sentence report was available to the judge and this concluded that the offender had expressed remorse for his actions and demonstrated an understanding of how his conduct had affected others. The report assessed the likelihood of him committing further offences of a violent nature as medium.
13.
There was also a psychiatric report which concluded that there were no relevant mental issues in the offender's case and that the likelihood of re-offending was low.
14.
Mr Mably, who has appeared for the Attorney-General, has helpfully drawn the court's attention to the aggravating and mitigating features in this case. The aggravating features are, first, that the offence was committed as a premeditated act of revenge. In our judgment, this is a significant feature in an arson case. There was in the present case the preplanning to the extent that it was necessary, first, to go away and obtain the petrol. Secondly, the offence was committed at night and accordingly at a time when it would have been obvious that the occupants of the house were likely to be asleep inside, as indeed they were, including two children. Third, the property was a mid terraced house. That plainly means that there is an increased risk of the fire spreading to adjoining properties. Fourth, the fire was started at the main entry and exit point of the house, the front door. Fifth, having started the fire the offender left the scene and did nothing to raise the alarm.
15.
As to the mitigating features, the offender pleaded guilty and was entitled to full credit for that. The fire was started outside the property rather than inside and in the event did not spread to the inside of the house. The offender is a man of previous good character and it is plain that there was substantial mitigation in that he had given long service to the public as a bus driver and there were many positive features to his life. Finally, this was a case in which not only was there a plea of guilty, but there was genuine remorse on the part of the offender.
16.
The judge's attention does not appear to have been drawn to any of the relevant authorities on sentence in arson cases. This, in our judgment, is most regrettable, not least because sentencing in arson cases is very often not by any means an easy exercise. Mr Mably, on the other hand, has been able to draw this court's attention to all of the authorities and that has been of considerable assistance to us.
17.
We should perhaps begin by making the possibly obvious observation that arson cases, like many other cases, are very much fact specific. But there are certain features that do arise from the authorities which it is particularly important to bear in mind.
18.
The first case to which we were referred is
Attorney-General Reference No 1 of 1997 (Glen Wheeler)
[1998] 1 Cr App R(S) 54. In that case the offender pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered. The nature of the offence is important, because arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered comes one stage below, in terms of gravity, arson with the specific intent to cause danger to life. In that case the offender started a fire in a ground floor flat by setting fire to a cushion on a settee whilst the occupant was in the flat asleep in bed. He knew that the occupant, Mr Perry, had been drinking and must also therefore have known that he might fall asleep. A probation order was varied to a sentence of four-and-a-half years' imprisonment following a plea of guilty. That was a case where McCowan LJ said at page 56 of the report:
""We consider that the right sentence in these cases, and certainly the right sentence in the present case, would have been one of six years...""
We repeat, that that was a case where there was a plea of guilty and the court went from 6 years to four-and-a-half years on the basis of double jeopardy. That was a substantial discount, we would observe, because it was a case where the offender was not already in custody.
19.
The next case is
R v Gerrard
[2004] 2 Cr App R(S) 11, at page 47. There the offence was again arson being reckless whether life would be endangered. In this instance by throwing a petrol bomb at the front door of a house occupied by a person who had given evidence against the appellant. A sentence of 7 years, following a plea of guilty, was reduced to 6 years, with 12 months consecutive for taking revenge against a witness. There are a number of features about the case of
Gerrard
that are similar to the present case, not least that that was a case involving an act of revenge.
20.
Attorney-General's Reference No 23 of 2001 (R v Fielder)
[2001] 2 Cr App R(S) 514, again involved an offence of reckless arson. In that case a sentence of three-and-a-half years was increased to 5 years. That was a case in which the offender knew that the premises were unoccupied. The sentence was passed, albeit with some doubt on the part of the appeal court on the basis that it was being treated as a spur of the moment offence.
21.
Then comes the case of
R v O'Brien
[2003] 2 Cr App R(S) 99, at page 599. Another case of reckless arson, this time following a conviction, where 10 years was reduced to 6 years. The premises in that case, however, were unoccupied. The offence was premeditated and the damage was caused inside the premises.
22.
Then
Attorney-General's Reference No 50 of 2005 (R v Andrews)
[2006] 1 Cr App R(S) 82, at page 473. That was a case of reckless arson, committed by somebody who was aware that the hostel to which he set fire was empty. A sentence of 3 years was imposed following conviction, the court saying that it should be increased to four-and-a-half years and that the appropriate sentence would have been one of 6 years.
23.
Then there is
R v Frankham
[2007] EWCA Crim 1320
in which Thomas LJ, giving the judgment of the court, said at paragraph 9:
""But the cases cited to us relating to the appropriate sentences for offenders who commit arson with intent to endanger life show that the starting point tends to fall in a range of eight to ten years' imprisonment.""
When we first read this authority we had some doubt as to whether that was the starting point that the judge considered appropriate following a trial, but we think that that must be the case when we look at his observations in the following paragraph and reference to two earlier authorities.
24.
Finally, we turn to
Attorney-General's Reference No 98 of 2001 (R v Hussain)
[2001] EWCA Crim 3068
. That was a reckless arson case. The premises were occupied by the offender's wife and daughter. After a trial lasting five days the offender was convicted. Mance LJ said at paragraph 37, that in that case a sentence of
at least
(and we emphasise those words ""at least"") 6 years would have been appropriate on an initial sentencing exercise. Mance LJ sought to distinguish the case from the earlier decision to which we have referred of
Wheeler
. What happened in this case is that a community rehabilitation order to which the appellant had been sentenced, was increased to a sentence of 4 years' imprisonment.
25.
Having given due consideration to all the authorities, it seems to us, in particular following the case of
Frankham
, that the starting point for arson with intent to endanger life is in the range of eight to 10 years (that would of course be following a trial); and in cases involving reckless arson, we would regard the range as rather below that, but it is apparent to us that the dividing line between the worst cases of reckless arson and the least serious cases of arson with intent to endanger life is a fine one. We are entirely satisfied that the aggravating features of the present case, which we have described, and even after taking into account the various mitigating features to which we have also referred, that this a case that falls at the upper end of offences of reckless arson.
26.
We have come to the clear conclusion that the sentence imposed on this offender was in the circumstances unduly lenient. We think that following a plea of guilty, a sentence approaching 6 years would have been appropriate in this case. That indeed takes into account the very substantial mitigation that this offender had. Taking into account the fact that he is being sentenced for the second time, we think that the appropriate sentence with which to replace two-and-a-half years is one of four-and-a-half years' imprisonment. The sentence will be varied accordingly with full credit for all the time spent in custody.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE HOOPER: On 20th November 2008 at the Crown Court at Chelmsford, the applicant was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The indictment read as follows. The applicant and Paul Hendle, ""between the 1st day of February 2006 and the 2nd day of August 2006, conspired together and with others unknown by falsely claiming to Essex Police and the West Midlands Police that they had been the victim of indictable offences and placed persons in jeopardy of arrest or criminal prosecution by such false allegations with intent to pervert the course of justice."" The applicant was convicted after a trial lasting some four weeks, during which time the trial judge, His Honour Judge Turner QC, had ample opportunity to make an assessment of her criminality.
2.
We should say that there was a considerable delay between the end of the indictment period and the trial, but that as we understand it was the responsibility of the applicant herself to the extent that she was able to convince the court on a number of occasions that she was not fit enough to attend her trial. Part of the delay was also caused, so we are told by counsel for the respondent, Mr Gursoy, by the fact that she changed her counsel.
3.
The applicant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment on 22nd December 2008 with a direction under
section 240 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
that 160 days on remand should count towards the sentence. Today she has been, if we may say so, very ably represented by Mrs Smullen who did not conduct the trial. Mrs Smullen has said everything that could possibly be said to assist the applicant in this application. There is also an application for an extension of time which we grant. The application for leave to appeal has been referred to the full court by the Registrar.
4.
Paul Hendle pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, less 355 days on remand.
5.
Taking the facts broadly, during a five month period in 2006 the applicant made a series of false allegations to the police. She claimed that she had been burgled, blackmailed, kidnapped on at least two occasions, raped and attacked with a knife. She further alleged that police officers were behind the various offences committed against her. A schedule, which the judge accepted, showed that the various investigations took some 7,000 hours of police time and cost some £316,000.
6.
One of the false allegations involved the applicant reporting that her car had been shot at by a motor cyclist. Paul Hendle admitted that he had done this so that the police would think that the applicant had actually been threatened. He said it had been her idea. The applicant also said she had information about the police acting corruptly in relation to a murder investigation in 1994 and that she had been targeted by police officers to silence her. There is some suggestion in the papers that she was motivated by the prospects of financial gain, but Mrs Smullen submits, and we accept, that that was likely only to apply to one or two of the matters being reported to the police.
7.
On 27th February she made a false allegation that her home had been burgled. On 14th April police officers received a call from the applicant's daughter. She said the applicant was in difficulty and said where her mother could be located. Armed police officers found the applicant tied up in a car. She was hysterical and said she had met the blackmailers but the police found she was still in possession of the keys to the car and her mobile phone. Her daughter was arrested at that time on suspicion of involvement with her mother in wasting police time. Indeed, the applicant was charged with wasting police time shortly thereafter.
8.
We refer to some of the other incidents. The applicant reported being stabbed in the arm. She told officers who attended that she had been stopped by what appeared to be a police car, that four men had showed what appeared to be police badges and that one of them had slashed her arm with a knife. On 27th May the applicant went to a house on an isolated lane and claimed that she had been raped twice during an attack by people with a knife. Her bra was ripped, there was tape on her hands and a bandage on her arm. Her car was found nearby. On 21st June the applicant claimed she had been kidnapped. She refused to hand over her mobile phone to the police but when it was analysed it showed that she had made a large number of calls during the time she claimed to have been kidnapped, but not one of those calls had been made to the police. By now the police were carrying out surveillance on her house and her account was contradicted by CCTV evidence.
9.
When she was interviewed she denied the offence. She said at the end of that interview:
""You haven't helped me from the start, you haven't helped me at the end, and all you've done has made matters 50 times worse. So screw your help, screw your resources and screw your power. That is all I'm going to say.""
At the trial she maintained her innocence and, as we say, it took four weeks for the trial to conclude.
10.
We have looked at the pre-sentence report that was prepared and that again shows not only her unwillingness to accept what had occurred but also a complete lack of remorse.
11.
She has previous convictions for two offences of deception involving cheques with 63 offences taken into consideration, but that was in 1990 and could not constitute an aggravating offence in determining what is the appropriate sentence for this conspiracy.
12.
The judge in his sentencing remarks said a number of things which bear repetition in this court. He said for example:
""You have, in statements and in your evidence, made and persisted in thoroughly unpleasant allegations of lies, bullying, targeting, humiliation, abuse and corruption by officers both in uniform and in the CID, from constables to a chief inspector. No rank has escaped your insinuation.""
The judge also said:
""You have duped and involved innocent members of the public as your rescuers and comforters, conning them by your tears and faux hysteria; and the result, as I have said, has been, literally, hundreds of hours of wasted police time and resources. Dozens of officers have been involved, directly and indirectly: uniformed and CID, armed officers, scenes of crime officers, helicopter pilots, police doctors, sexually trained officers, financial investigating officers, technical support officers, forensic specialists. Hours of Achieving Best Evidence interviews have been conducted. Hours of CCTV have been marshalled. There have been, literally, hours of evidence gathering, hundreds of phone calls and texts and hundreds of pages of notes and statements, all in pursuit of your fantasies. There has been a grotesquely wasteful programme of investigating, recording, photographing and sampling, all produced by your lies. This has all been carried out in a planned, premeditated, calculated and carefully executed way.""
13.
It is submitted on her behalf that no one was actually arrested as a result of the allegations that she made. That is right, but persons were questioned. We have already seen that her daughter was arrested and there can be no doubt that those who were the target of her allegations and others who recorded her false complaints (both lay people and police officers) would have suffered some stress as a result of what was happening. There is no doubt that the police had serious doubts about the validity of the complaints that were being made, but nonetheless, as Mrs Smullen rightly accepts, they were not able simply to treat the complaints as groundless, at least until much later on in the investigation. These were very serious allegations and had to be properly investigated.
14.
Mrs Smullen is right when she says that this applicant certainly has a number of problems, but we have looked carefully at the reports about her mental health and there is nothing in those reports to suggest that she is suffering from some mental illness which caused her to believe genuinely that she had suffered the attacks of which she made complaint. Mrs Smullen seems to be suggesting that the applicant genuinely believed what she had said. We for our part cannot accept that submission. If she genuinely believed what she was saying then there would be serious mental health issues which would have been properly explored at trial. We have already mentioned the absence of remorse and we add to that the fact that she blames others for the predicament in which she finds herself. We have mentioned the delay. During that period awaiting trial she was on bail and required to live away from the Essex area. The conditions imposed on her did prevent her from using her phone and when she travelled into the nearby city she had to be accompanied. But in our judgment that should not have any impact on the sentence which was passed.
15.
The pre-sentence report describes her as at low risk and in those circumstances Mrs Smullen submits the proper course now would be to suspend the sentence or to reduce the sentence.
16.
We have looked at this case with considerable care. It is a very unusual case. We have looked at cases to which we have been referred:
Inaam
[2006] EWCA Crim. 1073
and also
Walsh and Nightingale
[1993] 14 Cr.App.R (S) 671. Neither of those cases give us any assistance in deciding whether the judge's sentence of four years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive. We take the view at the end of the day that this was a severe sentence but passed by a judge who had ample opportunity to see the applicant over a considerable period of time and severe as it may have been it cannot be properly described as manifestly excessive. This application is refused.","citation:

Lord Justice Thomas :
1.
After a two month trial, the appellant and his wife were convicted at the Crown Court at Canterbury before HH Van Der Bijl and a jury of various offences (including obtaining property by deception, forgery and facilitating illegal entry) relating to the illegal entry into the United Kingdom of Romanian immigrants. Sentences of varying duration, some of them consecutive, amounting in total to seven years were passed on the appellant.
2.
His application for leave to appeal against conviction, as originally formulated, contained a very significant number of grounds. That application was referred to the Full Court on the understanding that, if leave to appeal was granted, a full hearing would follow; we granted leave to appeal. The grounds of appeal were significantly revised and can be grouped under three headings
i)
The admissibility of misconduct on other occasions and the directions given in the summing up in the light of the bad character provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
(CJA 2003).
ii)
The need for a direction on unanimity on the forgery counts.
iii)
The validity of count 12 - the charge of facilitating illegal entry.
The most important of these, both to the appellant and generally, was the first.
3.
As can be appreciated from the length of the trial, the circumstances in which the offences were committed and the evidence adduced by the prosecution were complex.
The factual background and evidence
4.
However for the purposes of the appeal we consider the background circumstances can be summarised briefly.
i)
The appellant was a Romanian national. He came to the United Kingdom in August 1993; after marriage to a British national, he was granted indefinite leave to remain in this country. That marriage was dissolved. On 13 June 2002 he married his co-defendant; prior to the marriage, using the name of Denise Dupont, she had lived with him in the United Kingdom at 9a Chancelot Road, Abbey Wood, London from November 2000 until June 2003. From June 2003 the appellant and his co-defendant lived at 85 Chandlers Drive, Erith and then at 33 Wallhouse Road, Erith.
ii)
In September 2002 the appellant obtained from a bureau in London, by payment of £440, what purported to be a degree of Bachelor of Laws with Honours in Criminal Law granted by Trinity College, Delaware, USA. He was granted British citizenship in May 2003.
iii)
It was the prosecution case that he had become involved by December 2002 in illegal immigration and was posing as a solicitor. On his arrest there was found in his possession business cards with the inscription of the appellant’s name, and “LLb(Hons), solicitor, of Tiko Solicitors, 24 Hr. Criminal Emergency Services” with an address in Dartford. There were no such solicitors.
5.
He was not charged with conspiracy, but with a number of specific counts in the indictment. The essence of the main allegations can again be summarised briefly.
i)
In count 1 of the indictment, he was charged, with his second wife, of making, or procuring the making, of a false French identification card in the name of Denise Dupont. The evidence relied on for this was the discovery by the police when searching the premises at 85 Chandlers Drive of a document purporting to be a French identify card in the name of Denise Dupont; when it was forensically examined, it was found to be counterfeit. The prosecution case was that Denise Dupont was the appellant’s wife and that the appellant made or procured the making of the false identity card. There was no issue that it was counterfeit; the issue was whether there was a Denise Dupont or whether the person for whom the card was to be used was the appellant’s wife and who procured or made the false identity card.
ii)
In counts 8-12 of the indictment the appellant was charged with a number of offences in relation to Monica Halarescu;
a)
Obtaining two sums of £3,500 from her by deception.
b)
Making or procuring the making of a false British passport in the name of Monica Halarescu;
c)
Making or procuring the making of a forged certificate of British naturalisation in the name of Monica Halarescu (Counts 10 and 11);
d)
Facilitating the illegal entry of Monica Halarescu (Count 12).
It was the prosecution case that he had falsely represented to her that he was a qualified solicitor, worked for the Home Office, was authorised to facilitate her application for a certificate of British nationality and a British passport, could supply such documents and was acting in good faith. The prosecution called Monica Halarescu and Nicolae Bilbie as their principal witnesses. Monica Halarescu’s evidence was she had met through Nicolae Bilbie a man who had said he was “Cornel Tirnaveanu” and that he was a lawyer working at the Home Office. It was the prosecution case that this individual was the appellant. Various representations were made to her as a result of which she handed over a total of £7,000 to that man and received from that man a UK passport and UK certificate of naturalisation. She went to Romania using the documents. On arrival the fact that the documents were forged was discovered; the fact that they were forged was not in issue. Bilbie’s evidence was he had given Monica Halarescu photographs of himself and personal details. When the police searched the appellant’s address, photographs of Bilbie were found at his house. Bilbie never met the lawyer who was to obtain a British passport for him.
iii)
In counts 13 to 18 of the indictment, the appellant was charged with obtaining £5,000 from Stefan Iamandi, Irina Iamandi and Ion Iordache by making representations similar to those made to Maria Halarescu and attempting to obtain a further £5,000 from each of them. All three were Romanians who had entered the UK illegally in 1998. Their evidence was that they had been told of a lawyer with connections with the Home Office who could help obtain a British passport and certificate of naturalisation. In June or July 2003 they were introduced to a person they understood to be Cornel Tirnaveanu. The prosecution contended that this man was the appellant. The three had expected to meet an English lawyer but were surprised that he was a Romanian. He made various representations to them about his ability to obtain a passport and each handed to him £5,000 together with their passport photographs and details. They then learnt that a friend who had introduced them to Cornel Tirnaveanu and who had obtained a passport from him had been arrested for being in possession of a forged passport. When they were telephoned by Cornel Tirnaveanu with news that the passport was ready, they met him at a coffee shop but did not bring any money to the meeting. They were shown documents but on discovering that they had not brought the money Cornel Tirnaveanu refused to hand over the documents. When the police searched 85 Chandlers Drive they found details of these three together with photographs of Iordache. The police thereafter contacted them.
iv)
There were four further counts of facilitating illegal entry (counts 19, 20 and 21) and of forgery of a photocard driving licence (count 22). It is not necessary at this stage to refer to the details of those further matters.
6.
In his interviews with the police and in his defence case statement, the appellant denied each and every allegation. He put the prosecution to proof. He also claimed he was not involved. An elaborate conspiracy had been set up to “frame him” as the person who was acting as the lawyer. If he had been involved, then there was no dishonesty as those who paid him for documents, must have realised that it was all a “scam”. In the event, neither the appellant nor his wife gave evidence at trial.
7.
In addition to the evidence to which we have referred, a substantial number of other witnesses were called. It is in relation to that evidence that the first group of grounds of appeal arose.
(1)
Admission of evidence of misconduct on other occasions and the directions to the jury
(a)
The nature of the evidence
8.
In order to meet the appellant’s case that it was not him, but some other person, who was involved in the provision of forged passports or false documents or in the illegal assistance of immigrants, the prosecution primarily relied upon the evidence of those witnesses directly relating to the counts which we have set out above. However during a search of the appellant’s properties, the police discovered a significant amount of paperwork relating to other Romanians whom the prosecution contended were illegal immigrants. We have already referred to the paperwork in connection with Bilbie at paragraph 5 (ii) above and that in relation to Iamandi and Iordache at paragraph 5 (iii) above. No objection was taken to the admissibility of that evidence.
9.
However, the prosecution wished to go further and to adduce:
i)
Evidence in relation to other documents found at the appellant’s houses which contained details referable to illegal immigrants. The prosecution wanted to call, in connection with those documents, evidence from the immigrants and evidence from immigration officers in relation to such immigrants.
ii)
Evidence of others to show that the appellant was acting as a lawyer and dealing with illegal immigrants. This second category of evidence can be illustrated by the evidence of Colin Martin, a British national now living in Romania. He was involved, on his own admission, in assisting Romanians to enter the UK illegally. At the end of November 2002 8 out of a group of 10 illegal immigrants who were being brought into the UK by Martin were caught at Dover; a telephone call was placed to a lawyer called Cornel Tirnaveanu who subsequently met with Martin at Dover and gave him a document advertising a 24 hour non stop helpline which had on it the appellant’s telephone number and a business card with the appellant’s name on it to which we have referred at paragraph iii). It was Martin’s evidence that the person who met him admitted to Martin that he was involved in assisting the illegal entry of immigrants into the UK, including the provision of passports. The description given by Martin of the person he met did not coincide with the appellant; nor did Martin pick out the appellant at an identification parade. The prosecution sought, however, to prove that the person who met Martin was indeed the appellant by showing that the appellant’s mobile telephone (subsequently found at his address) was in Dover on the day when Martin met the lawyer at Dover. They also sought to prove that the appellant was the lawyer who, when visiting the Oakington Immigration Reception Centre, had assisted another illegal immigrant, Mocanu, whom Martin had brought into the country.
10.
The prosecution sought through this further evidence (examples of which we have set out) to prove that it was in fact the appellant who was engaged as a lawyer in assisting illegal Romanian immigrants and that it was not another person purporting to be the appellant as the appellant claimed.
(b)
The appellant’s contentions
11.
Submissions were made on behalf of the appellant that this further evidence should not be admitted. Although the judge ruled that some of the evidence was inadmissible, a substantial amount of the evidence was ruled to be admissible. That evidence was duly heard in the course of the trial and directions given in respect of it by the judge in his summing up.
12.
It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the judge was wrong to admit the evidence and, having admitted it, had failed to give proper directions to the jury. The ruling made by the learned judge was on 5 October 2005 and the summing up delivered on 13 December 2005. Although by that time the bad character provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
had come into force, there was little authority to guide the judge. Moreover, it is apparent, as was observed in
Chopra
[2006] EWCA Crim 2133
, that the sea change in the law effected by the CJA 2003 had not been fully appreciated. Since that time this court has given guidance on these provisions and we are grateful to counsel for their marshalling of the authorities.
(c)
The approach in the light of the CJA and the authorities
13.
It may be helpful therefore if we set out the way in which we consider the issue of admissibility and the summing up should have been approached in the light of those authorities and examine the effect of the judge’s ruling and the summing up on that basis. We do not think it necessary to consider the way in which the judge approached admissibility in detail; the issues can, we think, be addressed by 6 questions which we considered during the course of argument on the hearing of the appeal.
(i)
Was the evidence relevant?
14.
In approaching the evidential issues in this case, it was necessary first of all to establish that the evidence was relevant. It is usually essential, when seeking to establish relevance, to consider the specific issue in the case to which the evidence is relevant.
15.
In the present case it is clear that, as we have set out, the evidence in relation to the other immigrants was highly relevant to proving that it was the appellant who had committed the offences charged and not some other person posing as the appellant, as the appellant claimed.
16.
It was contended by counsel for the appellant before us that the prosecution did not need this evidence as it had the evidence of those who had been the victims of the specific conduct complained of. However as long as the appellant was putting forward the defence that it was some other person and not him, the evidence was plainly relevant and the prosecution were entitled to call other evidence to strengthen their case, provided it was admissible.
(i)
Was the evidence of “bad character”?
17.
Once it was established that the evidence was relevant, it was next necessary to consider whether the evidence was evidence of “bad character” as defined by Chapter I of
Part 11
of the
CJA
2003, because, if it was, that statutory regime governed all further issues of admissibility and abolished the common law rules. “Bad character” has a very far reaching definition.
18.
S. 98 of the CJA
2003 provides:
““Bad character”
References in this Chapter to evidence of a person’s “bad character” are to evidence of, or of a disposition towards, misconduct on his part, other than evidence which –
a)
has to do with the alleged facts of the offence with which the defendant is charged, or
b)
is evidence of misconduct in connection with the investigation or prosecution of that offence.
S. 112 (1) defines misconduct as “the commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour”.
19.
There may initially have been some doubt as to whether an allegation of misconduct untested by a judicial finding was within the provisions. But as is clear from decisions of this court in
R v Edwards; R v Fysh
[2005] EWCA Crim 1813
(
[2006] 1 Cr.App.R.3
) at paragraphs 71 to 77,
R v Weir
[2005] EWCA Crim 2866
(
[2006] 1 Cr.App.R.19
) at paragraph 94,
R v Edwards and Rowlands
[2006] EWCA Crim 3244
([2006] 2 Cr App 4 at paragraphs 77-81 and
R v Leslie B.
[2006] EWCA Crim 2150
at paragraph 51, evidence that alleges the commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour is within the scope of the definition of misconduct.
20.
It was not in issue on this appeal that the evidence the prosecution sought to adduce was evidence of misconduct within the statutory definition.
(i)
Was the evidence “to do with the alleged facts of the offence”?
21.
S. 98 of the CJA
2003 excludes from the definition of bad character, misconduct on the part of a defendant which has “to do with the alleged facts of the offence with which the defendant is charged”. The contention of the prosecution was that the evidence was “to do” with the offences with which the appellant was charged. The consequence of that argument was that if the evidence was within the exclusion, then it was not for the purposes of the statutory provisions evidence of bad character and, as this court said in
R v Edwards and Rowlands
(at paragraph 1(i)) (as qualified in
Watson
[2006] EWCA Crim 2308
at paragraph 19), the evidence “may be admissible without more ado”.
22.
There is very little authority on the extent of this exclusion. In
R v Machado
[2006] EWCA Crim 1804
, the defendant charged with robbing a victim wished to use evidence that the victim had taken an ecstasy tablet shortly before the attack and immediately before the attack had offered to supply him drugs. This court held that the matters were in effect contemporaneous and so closely connected with the alleged facts of the offence and so were “to do” with the facts of the offence. In
Edwards and Rowlands
, this court observed at paragraph 23 that the term was widely drawn and wide enough to cover the finding of a pistol cartridge at the home of one of the defendants when it was searched in connection with the drugs offences with which the defendants were charged. In
McIntosh
[2006] EWCA Crim 193
, this court held that a matter immediately following the commission of the offence was “to do with the offence”. In
Watson
, an assault committed was held to do with the charge of rape committed upon the same person later in the day. Professor J R Spencer, QC in his useful monograph,
Evidence of Bad Character
at paragraph 2.23 suggested that it clearly covered acts which the defendant committed at the same time and place as the main offence and presumably covered acts by way of preparation for the main offence and an earlier criminal act which was the reason for the main crime.
23.
The basis on which it was contended before us by the prosecution that the evidence which they sought to adduce was “to do” with the facts of the alleged offence was that it was evidence which was central to the case in that it related to proving that the appellant was the person who had committed the offences charged in the various counts. We do not accede to that submission. As counsel for the prosecution accepted, if his submission was right, then in any case, where the identity of the defendant was in issue (including, by way of example, cases of sexual misconduct), the prosecution would be able to rely on this exclusion to adduce evidence of misconduct on other occasions which helped to prove identity. It seems to us that the exclusion must be related to evidence where there is some nexus in time between the offence with which the defendant is charged and the evidence of misconduct which the prosecution seek to adduce. In the commentary in the Criminal Law Review to
R v T
[2007] Crim LR 165, it was argued that the court in
Machado
and
McIntosh
had taken too narrow a view of s.98 thereby permitting prejudicial evidence to be admitted on the threshold test of relevance alone with no gateway having to be satisfied. We do not agree – the application of s.98 is a fact specific exercise involving the interpretation of ordinary words.
24.
We respectfully agree with Professor J R Spencer, QC
Evidence of Bad Character
at paragraph 2.23 where he suggests that there is a potential overlap between evidence that has to do with the alleged facts of the offence and evidence that might be admitted through one of the gateways in
section 101(1)
. As he observes in relation to the example he took of prior misconduct being the reason for the commission of the offence, such evidence could be admitted either as “to do” with the offence or as important explanatory evidence under s.101(1)(c):
“In practice nothing of any legal significance depends on which of these two routes it is by which the evidence comes in”.
(i)
Was the evidence admissible under one of the gateways in s. 101(1)?
25.
As the evidence was not “to do” with the alleged facts of the offence, then the next issue to consider was whether the evidence was admissible through one of the gateways in s. 101(1).
26.
It was not seriously disputed that the further evidence in this case was admissible under s. 101(1)(d), as it was relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution – whether it was the appellant who had committed the offences and not some other person.
(a)
Would the evidence have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that it ought not to be admitted?
27.
There are two relevant statutory provisions:
i)
S. 101(3) of the CJA
2003
“The court must not admit evidence under subsection (1)(d) or (g) if, on an application by the defendant to exclude it, it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.”
ii)
78(1) of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
(
PACE
):
“In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings the court ought not to admit it.”
As was made clear in
Highton
and
Weir
(at paragraph 44)
,
where the CJA 2003 does not permit s. 101(3) to be relied on, s.78 of
PACE
should be considered. In this instance the relevant provision is s. 101(3).
28.
The difference in the wording of the statutory provisions appears to relate solely to the question of whether the court has a discretion;
s 101(3) of the CJA
2003 provides that the court must exclude the evidence if the condition is satisfied whilst s.78(1) of
PACE
appears to give the court a discretion. However, as is clear from the decision of this court in
R v Chalkley & Jeffries
[1998] 2 Cr.App.R.79, this is a distinction without a difference as the court under s. 78(1) of
PACE
has no discretion once the condition is in its view satisfied: the court said at page:
“We have put the words “exercise of discretion” in this context in quotation marks because, as the court said in
Middlebrook and Caygill
(unreported), February 18, 1992, the task of determining (in)admissibility under section 78 does not strictly involve an exercise of discretion. It is to determine whether the admission of the evidence:
“having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, … would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.”
If the court is of that view, it cannot logically “exercise a discretion” to admit the evidence, despite the use of the permissive formula in the opening words of the provision that it “may refuse” to admit the evidence in that event.”
29.
In
Weir
at paragraphs 38 and 46 the court gave guidance on how the issue under s. 101(3) is to be approached by a balancing exercise; in
Edwards and Rowlands
at paragraph 82, the importance of the broad nature of the judge’s function was emphasised and the undesirability of descending into satellite litigation. However, for the reasons we have given we consider, unlike the court in
Weir
(whose attention was not drawn to
Chalkley & Jeffries
), that there is no difference between that section and s.78(1) of
PACE
and the guidance should be the same.
30.
We have carefully considered the potential effect of the evidence on the fairness of the proceedings and the undesirability of the jury having too many other matters to consider as against the powerful evidence in relation to the issue as to who committed the acts charged in the various counts. We consider the judge was right to decide to admit the evidence and that he correctly performed the balancing act. It was powerful and important evidence which in our judgment did not in any way affect the fairness of the proceedings.
(vi)
Did the jury need help in the summing up as to how to use this evidence?
31.
As this court observed in
R v Hanson
[2005] EWCA Crim 824
(
[2005] 2 Cr. App. R. 21
) and in subsequent decisions, particularly
R v Edwards; R v Fysh
at paragraphs 3 and 77,
Highton
[2005] EWCA Crim 1985
(
[2006] 1 Cr App R 7
) at paragraphs 11 and 38-43,
R v Edwards and Rowlands
at paragraphs 1(ii) and 1(iv) and
MM
[2006] EWCA Crim 2317
at paragraph 14, it was important to consider, when evidence was admitted under the bad character provisions, what help by way of any directions needed to be given to the jury. The bad character provisions are most commonly used to admit evidence of previous convictions and, following the decision in
Hanson,
the Judicial Studies Board have provided guidance in relation to the directions to be given in such a case. Those directions primarily deal with the evidence which is relevant to propensity.
32.
But as the decisions of this court indicate, the important question that a court must consider, when deciding what help may be need to be given to the jury in the summing up, is the relevance of the evidence which was admitted. If the evidence has been admitted for a particular purpose, the jury may, depending on the circumstances, need to be told how they should use that evidence and the issue to which it goes.
33.
Furthermore, as is clear from the decision of this court in
Highton
at paragraphs 9 and 10, evidence admitted through one gateway can be used, once admitted, as relevant evidence on other issues. Moreover, as this court emphasised in
Chopra
[2006] EWCA Crim 2133
at paragraph 14, the provisions of the Act also have to be brought into account when considering directions on cross-admissibility of evidence on one count in relation to other counts. In short, when a court is dealing with evidence admitted under the “bad character” provisions, the relevance and purpose for which the evidence is being used by the end of the trial should be clear and, where appropriate, a direction in simple and clear terms given as to its relevance and the use the jury may make of it.
34.
In the present case, the prosecution did not rely upon the cross-admissibility of evidence between one count and the other. A direction was given by the judge to treat each count separately. No criticism was made of the judge in this respect. Nor did the purpose for which the evidence was admitted change; it remained evidence that went to the issue of whether it was the appellant or some other person who had committed the offences charged.
35.
The judge considered, prior to summing up, the nature of the direction to be given and it was raised with counsel. It is clear from the summing up that the judge considered that the appropriate direction he should give was one in relation to circumstantial evidence. Before referring to the further evidence in his summing up, he referred to it as “background and circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution.” Much earlier in his summing up he had given a direction in relation to circumstantial evidence in terms based upon the guidance given by the Judicial Studies Board. He said,
“This simply means that the prosecution is relying upon evidence of various circumstances relating to the charges and to the defendant that you are dealing with, which the Crown say, when taken together, will lead to the sure conclusion that it was that defendant who committed the offence. Circumstantial evidence can be powerful evidence, but it is important that you examine it with care and consider whether the evidence upon which the prosecution relies in proof of its case is reliable and whether it does prove guilt. Furthermore, before convicting on circumstantial evidence you should consider whether it reveals any other circumstances which are or may be of sufficient reliability and strength to weaken or destroy the prosecution case.”
36.
It was submitted to us on behalf of the appellant that the judge should have told the jury that the evidence in question was evidence which the prosecution sought to rely upon to prove that it was the appellant who had committed the offences in question and not some other person; that the jury should first consider in respect of each piece of that evidence whether they were sure that it was the appellant who had been involved and it was only if they were sure that they should use that material in considering whether it was the appellant who had committed each of the offences with which he was charged.
37.
In our judgment the learned judge should have set out in clear and simple terms the relevance of the evidence of other conduct and the way in which the jury should have approached it; this could have been done in a simple sentence or two. However, in our view, there can be little doubt that at the end of a trial extending over two months the jury had at the forefront of their minds the relevance of the other evidence and the use they could make of it – namely to show that it was the appellant who was engaged in the offences charged and that it was not some other person purporting to be him. That that was the issue was also clear from the general directions given in the summing up; the judge told the jury that they had to be sure of the reliability of that other evidence before they could use it in determining the appellant’s guilt of the offences charged.
38.
It was also submitted to us on behalf of the appellant that the judge should have given a specific direction that the jury were not to use the evidence of the other conduct as evidence of propensity. It was submitted that a jury might feel that if they heard evidence of misconduct in relation to other matters they might consider that this showed the appellant was someone who is engaged in criminal activity and convict him on that basis.
39.
We do not consider that a direction in such terms was either appropriate or necessary. There was no doubt that the person who was in fact engaged in the conduct specifically charged in the differing counts in the indictment was guilty of the offences; the issue in the case was one of identity, not propensity. Moreover, the judge did in fact give a good character direction, as the appellant had no previous convictions.
40.
We therefore consider, approaching the issues on the basis of the six questions, that the judge was clearly correct in admitting the evidence. Although the judge should have given a simple and brief direction on the use the jury could make of the further evidence, in our view, it must have been very clear to the jury the issue to which that evidence went and that therefore the failure of the judge to give a specific direction did not make the conviction unsafe. This ground of appeal therefore fails
(2)
Was a
Brown
direction on unanimity necessary in relation to the forgery counts?
41.
In counts 1, 10 and 11 the indictment charged the appellant under
section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981
of making or procuring the making of a false instrument; in count 1 it was the identity card, in count 10 a passport and in count 11 a certificate of British naturalisation. The particulars to each of the counts were in the same form; taking Count 10 as an example, the particulars stated:
“Cornel Tirnaveanu, on a day between 1
st
day of January 2003 and the 27
th
day of November 2003 made or procured the making of a false instrument, namely a document purporting to be a British passport, in the name of Monica Halarescu, with the intention that she or another should use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine and by reason of so accepting it to do some act, or not to do some act, to their own or another person’s prejudice.”
42.
We were told that the prosecution framed the particulars in that way, as it was unclear to them whether the appellant had been the principal offender by making the false instrument or a secondary party by procuring the making of it. It was submitted by them that the different ways of committing the offence were properly joined in the indictment on the basis of the decision in
Gaughan
[1990] 155 JP 235
.
43.
It was not disputed by the appellant that it was possible to join in the same count the allegation that the appellant had acted either as the principal in making the false passport or as a secondary party in procuring it, but contended, however, that this was a case when a direction should have been given of the kind set out in
R v Brown (K)
(1984) 79 Cr App R 115 as to the necessity of the jury being unanimous as to whether he was a principal or secondary party. The prosecution contended that such a direction was not necessary.
44.
In
Brown
, the court made clear it was a fundamental principle that in arriving at their verdict, the jury, even if they were not agreed as to part of the evidence, had to be unanimous that each ingredient necessary to constitute the offence had been established. The position was summarised by Eveleigh LJ at page 119:
“Each ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of each and every member of the jury (subject to majority direction). 2. However, where a number of matters are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the offence, and any one is capable of doing so, then it is enough to establish the ingredient that any one of them is proved; but (because of the first principle above) any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly, and it should be made clear to them as well that that they should all be satisfied that the statement upon which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.”
45.
It was submitted that, as it was an essential ingredient of the offence that the appellant had either made the false instrument or had procured the making of the instrument, the jury had therefore to be agreed as to which it was.
46.
We do not accede to that submission. Where a person is indicted both as a principal and as a secondary party and the prosecution cannot say which, then the jury is entitled to convict if they are satisfied that he committed the offence as a principal or, if he did not, he was a secondary party (who procured or encouraged the commission of the offence). They can do so only if there is no relevant or material difference in relation to the issues between these alternatives. A
Brown
direction is in such circumstances not necessary. This it seems to us follows from the decision in
R v Giannetto
[1997] 1 Cr App R 1, where a defendant was charged with killing or procuring the killing of his wife. After an extensive review of the authorities, Kennedy LJ giving the judgment of the court concluded at page 8:
“Having considered the authorities with some care we are satisfied that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge was right not to direct the jury that before they could convict they must all be satisfied either that the appellant killed his wife or that he got someone else to do so. They were entitled to convict if they were all satisfied that if he was not the killer he at least encouraged the killing, and accordingly this ground of appeal fails.
There are two cardinal principles. The first is that the jury must be agreed upon the basis on which they find a defendant guilty. The second is that a defendant must know what case he has to meet. When the Crown allege, fair and square, that on the evidence, the defendant must have committed the offence either as principal or as secondary offender, and make it equally clear that they cannot say which, the
basis
on which the jury must be unanimous is that the defendant, having the necessary
mens rea
, by whatever means caused the result which is criminalised by the law. The Crown is not required to specify the means, because the legal definition of the crime does not require it; and the defendant knows perfectly well what case he has to meet. Of course, if (as will very often be so) the Crown nail their colours to a particular mast, their case will, generally, have to be established in the terms in which it is put. Our judgment should give no encouragement to prosecutors casting around for alternative possibilities where the essential evidence does not show a clear case against the defendant. But the facts of the present appeal are by no means an instance of that.
47.
In reaching its decision, the court referred, with approval, to a comment in the Criminal Law Review by the late Professor Sir John Smith QC at [1990] Crim.L.R. 881 on
Gaughan
, the case to which we referred at paragraph 42:
“It is fundamental that the defendant should be told as precisely as possible what he is alleged to have done and that he should not be charged with doing one thing and convicted of doing something else. There will be occasions, however, when it is impossible to specify the mode of participation before the trial and where the case may have to be left to the jury on the basis that the defendant was either a principal or an accessory. It has long been established that this is permissible:
Swindall v. Osborne
(1846) 2 C. & K. 230.”
48.
However, as is illustrated by the two cases to which we were referred by the appellant, a
Brown
direction may be necessary where there are two or more clear alternatives open to the jury where there is a relevant or material difference as to the issues and therefore the basis on which the jury might convict:
i)
In
R v Carr
[2000] Cr App R 149
, it was the prosecution case that the defendant had either karate kicked the deceased or struck him with his fist. On the facts of the case, if the crucial blow was the punch, then the issue for the jury was whether it was a punch but if it was the karate kick, the issue was one of identification. The Court concluded that in the circumstances the judge should have told the jury that they must reach a unanimous verdict on the deliberate act which they found proved and the unlawfulness of the act:
“There was in our judgment a real risk that some jurors might have found the defendant to have kicked the deceased and others found him to have delivered a punch, feeling themselves entitled to convict because the judge had told them that the defendant could be convicted on either basis. Had that happened there would have been six jurors not satisfied that the defendant had delivered the fatal kick and six jurors not satisfied that the deceased had been felled by a punch by the appellant. The absence of such a direction on the facts of this case was in our judgment a fatal flaw and we consider that that real risk existed.
We wish to make it plain that we are not seeking to lay down any general rule. There will often be minor differences between the facts alleged and the evidence given by various witnesses, and there is no need for agreement between all jurors on fine factual differences. Here, however, the difference between the two forms of assault did not depend on fine factual differences, but on a stark difference in the evidence of witnesses describing the two events, those two forms of assault giving rise to very different defences.”
ii)
In
R v D
[2001] 1 Cr App R 13
, a defendant was charged with indecent assault on various occasions. The counts particularised the different occasions, but not the four different ways in which the indecent assaults were said to have happened on some or all of the occasions. No
Brown
direction was given. As the court pointed out, the failure opened up the possibility of a conviction on one or more counts when not only might juror A and juror B have differed in their view as to what had happened on the particular occasion represented by the count, but the view of juror A as to what occurred might relate to a time or occasion different from that on which the view of juror B was based.
49.
In our view this was a case where there was no difference in the issues or the defence to the charges under counts 1, 10 and 11; the issue was who made or procured the making of the instrument and in addition, in relation to Count 1 whether there was a person called Denise Dupont. This was not a case where there were fine factual differences or other relevant difference between the alternatives where the jury could disagree as to the basis on which they might convict. As between the two alternatives of principal and secondary party, the position was that, if it was not the first alternative – making the false instrument- then it must be the second - procuring the making. There was no relevant difference in these alternatives. In such circumstances therefore there was no need for unanimity as to which of these alternatives it was; a
Brown
direction was not necessary. In our view this was a case which fell within the principles set out in
Giannetto.
The difference in the basis for conviction was immaterial for the reasons fully explained by the late Professor Sir John Smith QC in an article in the Criminal Law Review
, Satisfying the Jury
[1988] Crim LR 335, referred to recently by this court in
R v Morton
[2003] EWCA Crim 1501
. He took the facts of
Stapylton v O’Callaghan
[1973] 2 All ER 782
as an illustration of the applicable principle:
“But the hypothetical case was put, suppose half of a jury were satisfied that the defendant was the original thief and half satisfied that he was the subsequent receiver.”
It is now quite impossible to say that the jury is satisfied that he was the thief on occasion (a); and equally impossible to say that it is satisfied that he stole on occasion (b). Indeed, it follows by necessary implication that six jurors are satisfied that he was not the thief on occasion (a); and six are satisfied that he did not steal on occasion (b). The case is, however, distinguishable from that which arose in
Brown
. The jurors are all presumably satisfied that the property was stolen by someone on occasion (a) and that the defendant was soon afterwards found in possession of it. They are all satisfied as to the same primary facts. The whole jury has dismissed any innocent explanation of the incriminating circumstances the defendant may have offered and is satisfied that he acted dishonestly in the matter. It seems to follow that the jurors who are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he stole on occasion (a) are also satisfied that, if they are wrong about that, he stole on occasion (b); and vice versa. The whole jury is satisfied that he stole the property in question either on occasion (a) or on occasion (b). The situation is significantly different from
Brown
. The jurors there could not say, ""But if deception (a) was not proved, then deception (b) was."" It is true that the prosecution have failed to satisfy the jury as to which of two possible occasions was the occasion of the theft but it seems not unreasonable to regard that matter as immaterial. This, indeed, is the situation in
Stapylton v. O'Callaghan
itself.
Professor Sir John Smith QC concluded:
“It is submitted that the principle stated in
Brown
is right and of general application. It should not, however be stretched to situations like that in
Stapylton v. O'Callaghan
where, as demonstrated above, it does not properly apply. It does apply, however, when the prosecution allege more than one factual basis for the crime charged and it is not possible to say, ""If it was not the one, then it must have been the other."" When
Brown
applies then, it is submitted, the jury should always be directed that they must all be satisfied as to the one basis or all satisfied as to the other, or both. In
More
(
[1988]1 WLR 1578
), having stated the requirement of unanimity, Lord Ackner added: ""It is equally essential that a jury should be directed in a manner that is easily comprehensible and devoid of unnecessary complications.""
No one could quarrel with that but the question remains, what is an unnecessary complication? Any complexity which is necessary to enable the jury to understand that they must be unanimous on any issue on which the law requires unanimity is a necessary complication.”
50.
For these reasons therefore the second ground of appeal also fails.
(3)
The validity of count 12 - the charge of facilitating illegal entry
51.
Until 10 February 2003,
s. 25(1) of the Immigration Act 1971
provided:
“Any person knowingly concerned in making or carrying out arrangements for securing or facilitating –
(a)
the entry into the United Kingdom of anyone whom he knows or has reasonable cause for believing to be an illegal entrant;
(b)
the entry into the United Kingdom of anyone whom he knows or has reasonable cause for believing to be an asylum claimant; or
(c)
the obtaining by anyone of leave to remain in the United Kingdom by means which he knows or has reasonable cause for believing to include deception,
shall be guilty of an offence, punishable on summary conviction with a fine of not more than the prescribed sum or with imprisonment for not more than six months, or with both, or on conviction on indictment with a fine or with imprisonment for not more than ten years, or with both.”
52.
With effect from 10 February 2003, s. 143 of the Nationality Immigration Asylum Act 2002 substituted a new s. 25 replaced s.25(1) and provided by the new (1) and (2):
“(1)
A person commits an offence if he –
(a)
does an act which facilitates the commission of a breach of immigration law by an individual who is not a citizen of the European Union,
(b)
knows or has reasonable cause for believing that the act facilitates the commission of a breach of immigration law by the individual, and
(c)
knows or has reasonable cause for believing that the individual is not a citizen of the European Union.
(2)
In subsection (1) “immigration law” means a law which has effect in a member State and which controls, in respect of some or all persons who are not nationals of the State, entitlement to –
(a)
enter the State,
(b)
transit across the State, or
(c)
be in the State.”
53.
The penalty under the original s. 25 was 10 years; under the
section 25
substituted from 10 February 2003, the penalty was 14 years.
54.
Count 12 on the indictment charged the defendant with facilitating illegal entry into the United Kingdom contrary to
s. 25 of the Immigration Act 1971
. It gave the following particulars of the offence:
“Cornel Tirnaveanu between the 1
st
day of January 2003 and 27
th
day of November 2003 was knowingly concerned in making or carrying out arrangements for facilitating the obtaining of leave to remain in the United Kingdom by Monica Halarescu by means which he knew to include deception, namely by supplying her with a false British passport and a false certificate of British naturalisation.”
55.
As can be seen from the wording of the indictment the particulars of the offence related to the way s. 25 was framed prior to 10 February 2003, but the appellant was charged with an offence between 1 January and 27 November 2003. After 10 February 2003 the offence charged was different and therefore the particulars should therefore necessarily have been different.
56.
If Parliament had, instead of substituting provisions of s. 25, created a different numbered section, there should have been no confusion. One count would have charged the activity under the old provision and another count would have charged the activity under the new provision. The confusion that seems to have arisen in this case is because the section number remained the same but the offence was changed. That makes no difference to the principle involved. The alleged activity prior to 10 February 2003 should have been charged in one count and the activity after 10 February 2003 should have been charged in a different count, as it would constitute a different offence. A count spanning the period and charging in one count two quite different offences was impermissible.
57.
In
Pritchett & Langston
[2007] EWCA Crim 586
, an indictment charged the defendant with keeping a brothel contrary to
s.33A of the Sexual Offences Act 1956
between 5 October 1998 and 30 September 2005;
s.33A of the Sexual Offences Act 1956
was added to that Act by
s.53 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003
and only came into effect on 1 May 2004. The indictment therefore charged the two defendants over part of a period where the offence with which they were charged was not an offence at law. The court held that, although the indictment gave rise to an irregularity, the indictment was not a nullity as, if the prosecution could prove the commission of the offence between 1
May 2004 and 30 September 2005, the defendants could be convicted under the indictment. The court considered that there was sufficient evidence which had enabled the prosecution to do this. In our view the present case is very different in the way in which the indictment was framed for the reasons we have set out. Furthermore the prosecution did not suggest that they could in the present case prove that an offence had been committed on the basis set out in
Pritchett and Langston.
58.
We will allow the appeal on count 12 on this ground and quash the conviction on that count. We should add that other grounds were advanced in relation to this count, including the failure to give a direction on the meaning of the words “leave to remain”. No such direction was given. If count 12 had not suffered from the deficiency to which we have referred, there would have been a serious issue for our consideration as to whether the failure to give such a direction made the conviction unsafe, but it is not in the circumstances necessary for us to determine the point.
Conclusion
59.
We have considered the overall safety of the convictions and in particular the approach the jury may have followed which resulted in the acquittal on Count 7. We consider that the convictions are safe, except that on Count 12 where the indictment charged the appellant in an impermissible manner; on the other counts on which he was convicted there was compelling evidence which underpins the jury’s verdict. In the result, therefore, we consider that the conviction on count 12 must be quashed, but the appeal on the other counts is dismissed. As the sentence on count 12 was concurrent, this makes no difference to the overall term of imprisonment which the appellant must serve.","citation:

    Exact: nd Nicolae Bilbie as their principal witnesses. Monica Halarescu’s evidence was she had met through Nicolae Bilbie a man who had said he was “Cornel Tirnaveanu” and that he was a lawyer working at the Home Office. It was the prosecution case that this individual was the appellant. Various representations were made to her as a result of which she handed over a total of £7,000 to that man and received from that man a UK passport and UK certificate of naturalisation. She went to Romania using the documents. On arrival the fact that the documents were forged was discovered; the fact that they were forged was not in issue. Bilbie’s evidence was he had given Monica Halarescu photographs of himself and personal details. When the police searched the appellant’s address, photographs of Bilbie were found at his house. Bilbie never met the lawyer who was to obtain a British passport for him.iii)In counts 13 to 18 of the indictment, the appellant was charged with obtaining £5,000 from Stefan Iamandi, Irina Iamandi and Ion Iordache by making representations similar to those made to Maria Halarescu and attempting to obtain a further £5,000 from each of them. All three were Romanians who had entered the UK illegally in 1998. Their evidence was that they had been told of a lawyer with connections with the Home Office who could help obtain a British passport and certificate of naturalisation. In June or July 2003 they were introduced to a person they understood to be Cornel Tirnaveanu. The prosecution contended that this man was the appellant. The three had expected to meet an English lawyer but were surprised that he was a Romanian. He made various representations to them about his ability to obtain a passport and each handed to him £5,000 together with their passport photographs and details. They then learnt that a friend who had introduced them to Cornel Tirnaveanu and who had obtained a passport from him had been arrested for being in possession of a forged passport. When they were telephoned by Cornel Tirnaveanu with news that the passport was ready, they met him at a coffee shop but did not bring any money to the meeting. They were shown documents but on discovering that they had not brought the money Cornel Tirnaveanu refused to hand over the documents. When the police searched 85 Chandlers Drive they found details of these three together with photographs of Iordache. The police thereafter contacted them.iv)There were four further counts of facilitating illegal entry (counts 19, 20 and 21) and of forgery of a photocard driving licence (count 22). It is not necessary at this stage to refer to the details of those further matters.

1.
MR JUSTICE GOOSE: On 22 January 2018, the appellant, Christopher Fletcher, who is aged 40, was sentenced in the Crown Court at Stoke-on-Trent to imprisonment for 8 years and 2 months. He had pleaded guilty to drugs offences on two indictments. On the first indictment, T20160268, the appellant pleaded guilty to possessing a controlled drug of class A with intent, crack cocaine, contrary to section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, being count 1; and of a similar offence in relation to heroin, being count 2. On the second indictment, T20170452, the appellant pleaded guilty to a further offence of possession of a controlled drug of class A with intent, heroin, also contrary to section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
2.
He was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment on each of the offences with those offences on the first indictment running concurrently with each other but consecutive to the offence on the second indictment. In addition, the appellant was sentenced after his plea to failing to surrender to custody, for which he received a consecutive sentence of 2 months' imprisonment, making 8 years and 2 months in all.
3.
The appellant appeals with leave from the single judge upon grounds that the total sentence was manifestly excessive because the appellant was a drug addict whose supply of drugs was in order to fund his own habit and to buy alcohol for himself. Secondly, the nature and extent of the dealing was such that despite the aggravating features, the starting point for sentence should have been at a lower range. Thirdly, insufficient account was given to the principle of totality when making the sentences consecutive. No criticism is made of the consecutive sentence for the failing to surrender to custody offence.
4.
The facts of these offences can be started shortly. On 16 March 2016, the appellant was arrested in a public house in Burselm, Stoke-on Trent and found to be in possession of 3.05 grams of crack cocaine with a street value of £320 and 18.7 grams of heroin with a street value of £1,060. He was also in possession of £495 in cash.
5.
After his arrest, he was granted bail to attend court for his trial in November 2016 but failed to attend and remained at large for 13 months.
6.
On 20 December 2017, the police attended at an address in Bank Street, Rookery to execute a search warrant. There they found the appellant in the rear bedroom. He was in possession of 21 grams of heroin with a street value of £2,100, together with measuring scales and dealer bags.
7.
The appellant has 12 previous convictions for 35 offences, which include a conviction for possession of a controlled drug of class A with intent to supply on 24 February 2012 for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 39 months.
8.
In sentencing the appellant, His Honour Judge Glenn, the Honorary Recorder of Stoke-on-Trent, accepted the appellant's basis of plea in relation to the first indictment, namely that he had stolen the drugs and cash from his own drugs supplier, but that he admitted that he was to supply some of the drugs to others. The judge correctly found that such a basis offered little by way the mitigation. The appellant was sentenced on the basis that he was a street dealer and that he had played a significant role in the offences because he was motivated by financial or other advantage.
9.
The guideline for supplying or offering to supply a controlled drug of class A under the drugs offences definitive guideline provided a starting point for these offences of 4 years and 6 months' custody, with a sentencing range of 3 years 6 months to 7 years.
10.
The judge identified the appellant's previous conviction for a similar offence as being a seriously aggravating factor of the seriousness of these offences. Further, given that the second indictment comprised a further offence while on bail, the judge imposed consecutive sentencing between the two indictments.
11.
A discount for pleading guilty was applied of 10 per cent in respect of the first indictment, when the appellant had failed to surrender for trial but pleaded guilty after his further arrest; and 25 per cent in respect of the second indictment.
12.
The sentence for each of the two counts on the first indictment was 5 years' imprisonment reduced to four and a half years with a discount for pleading guilty of 10 per cent. On the second indictment, committed when the appellant was not only on bail but also had absconded and avoided his trial, the sentence was 6 years' imprisonment reduced to four and a half years for the plea discount of 25 per cent. Both sentences were then reduced to 4 years' imprisonment each to reflect the totality principle, discounting the consecutive total sentence by one year.
13.
On behalf of the appellant, it is argued that the judge should, despite the aggravating features of the offences, have adopted a starting point at a lower range than he did.
14.
However, we are satisfied that the judge correctly identified the culpability and the harm of these offences within the guideline so as to reach the appropriate starting point for class A drugs with intent to supply. There were significant aggravating features, which required an upward adjustment from the starting point, and in circumstances in which the appellant was on bail when he committed the offence in the second indictment, consecutive sentencing was justified.
15.
It is further argued on behalf of the appellant that there should have been a greater reduction in sentence when applying the totality principle. The judge obviously took into account the principle when expressly reducing the sentences on each indictment by 6 months, which when making those sentences consecutive applied a 1 year discount to the total sentence. Such a discount was entirely within the judicial discretion of the judge when imposing sentence.
16.
Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the appellant with care, we are not persuaded that the sentence of 8 years and 2 months' imprisonment for this appellant's offending was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. Having committed a similar offence in 2012 for which he received a significant prison sentence, this further offending, some of which while being on bail, cannot be criticised.
17.
In the circumstances, we dismiss this appeal.

1.
LORD JUSTICE AIKENS: This is an appeal against conviction by Sergio South. The appeal is made with the leave of the single judge.
2.
On 9 September 2010 in the Crown Court at Bournemouth, after a trial before HHJ Harvey Clark QC and a jury, the appellant was convicted of burglary. On 8 October 2010 the appellant was sentenced to 39 months' imprisonment for that offence. At the same time, he was sentenced to a total of 15 months' imprisonment for other offences with which we are not concerned. The total sentence of imprisonment imposed was therefore 54 months. The judge ordered that 185 days spent in custody on remand should count against that sentence.
3.
The facts giving rise to the charge are as follows. On 13 November 2009 a house at 67 Richmond Park Road, Bournemouth was burgled between the hours of 12.30pm and 3.30pm. At the time three students lived there. One of them was Spencer Dale. The other two students were Jason and Shane Morgan. Mr Dale left the house at about 12.30pm. He did so through the back door, as was the usual practice for the three students who preferred to use that door rather than the front door. The two Morgans were at that time asleep.
4.
At about 3pm Jason came downstairs and saw that the glass pane to the front door, just above the lock, had been smashed and that the door had been opened. A plastic money jar, aftershave, perfume, an iPod Shuffle, an X-Box, a camera and a black rucksack had all been taken.
5.
On the floor below the letterbox of the front door there were some envelopes which had footmarks on them. These envelopes were subsequently given to the police and they were forensically examined. The evidence concerning those footprints was adduced at the trial.
6.
The appellant had three previous convictions for dwelling house burglaries between March 1998 and July 2003 and one conviction for attempted dwelling house burglary in October 2007. He was arrested in respect of this case on 15 November 2009, and his clothes and shoes were taken by the police. Amongst his possessions the police found an iPod. On the following day Mr Dale identified that iPod as being the one that had been stolen in the burglary.
7.
The appellant was charged and cautioned on 23 December 2009. He made no reply after caution.
8.
The defence case statement was served in March 2010. It did not mention a defence of alibi. On the first day of the trial, on 6 September 2010, the appellant served a Notice of Intention to introduce Alibi Evidence.
9.
At the trial the prosecution case was that the appellant had burgled the house. The prosecution relied on (1) the forensic evidence concerning the footmarks on the envelopes, which the forensic scientist, Michael Jones, said provided ""moderately strong"" evidence as coming from the footwear seized from the appellant. (2) The prosecution relied on the fact that the iPod which Mr Dale had said was his and was taken from the house was found in the appellant's possessions upon arrest. (3) The prosecution was permitted to adduce ""bad character"" evidence of the appellant's previous convictions concerning dwelling house burglaries. The prosecution said that those convictions demonstrated a propensity to commit similar offences such as this one. (4) The prosecution relied upon the fact that the appellant had had the opportunity to put forward his alibi defence and an explanation of how the iPod came to be in his possession when he was arrested and cautioned but he had not done so.
10.
The defence case was that between 10.30 or 11am until about 4pm on 13 November 2009, the appellant had been at the house of Mr Michael White, helping him repair a motorcycle. The appellant said he had not been involved in the burglary. His case was and his evidence was that he had bought the iPod from a beggar who had asked £10 for it, saying that he (the beggar) had found it in a gutter. The appellant said in evidence that he had given the beggar £3 for it to ""get him off my back"".
11.
After the appellant had given evidence and the defence was about to call Mr Michael White in relation to the alibi defence, the prosecution applied, under
section 100(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
to adduce ""bad character"" evidence relating to Mr White's previous convictions. He was then a man of 49 who had been convicted of 53 different offences of dishonesty between 1978 and 1996. The offences involved theft, burglary, handling, obtaining by deception, forgery, using false instruments and other similar offences. Having heard argument, the judge ruled that the application be allowed.
12.
In his ruling the judge said that the evidence that Mr White might be giving from the witness box ""is a matter in issue in the proceedings, and insofar as it purports to support the defendant's alibi, is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole"". The judge held that the fact that Mr White had ""so many convictions"" for dishonesty went very much to his credibility. The judge said that he recognised that the last of those convictions was in 1996. However, he also said that those convictions showed that for 18 years of Mr White's life he ""was habitually committing offences of dishonesty"". Therefore, despite the fact that there had been no convictions since 1996, the judge ruled that the fact of those convictions was a matter that should be drawn to the attention of the jury if Mr White gave evidence, because it was a matter that went to his credibility as a witness. It was particularly important, the judge said, because it was the prosecution case that the defendant had ""concocted"" his alibi.
13.
Michael White then gave evidence to the effect that the appellant was with him from about 12 noon on 13 November for about 4-5 hours. He accepted that he had the convictions listed. However, he said, ""I don't think that I have ever lied on behalf of myself. Most of the offences I pleaded guilty to, but three or four I pleaded not guilty. When I pleaded not guilty and was found guilty the court got it wrong"". Mr White said that the appellant told him in January 2010 that he faced the burglary charge and that it was subsequently, as a result of talking to his partner, that he (Mr White) thought that the appellant was with him on 13 November 2009.
14.
When the judge summed up the matter to the jury, he reminded them of Mr White's evidence and the fact of his convictions, and Mr White's evidence about those convictions. The judge did not give the jury any directions on what effect, if any, the fact of those convictions should have on their approach to Mr White's evidence of the alibi or possible alibi of the appellant, or on their approach to the issue of Mr White's credibility as a witness.
15.
The principal ground of appeal is that the judge erred in admitting all of the 53 previous convictions of Mr White as ""non-defendant bad character"" evidence pursuant to
section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
. As an alternative, it is submitted that the judge should have restricted the number of convictions that he admitted to those that concerned offences involving ""untruthfulness"". It is submitted that the judge failed properly to exercise his judgment in not limiting the number of convictions admitted.
16.
Sections 100(1)
, (2), (3)(a) and (b) and sub-section (4) of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
as follows:
""100 Non-defendant’s bad character.
(1) In criminal proceedings evidence of the bad character of a person other than the defendant is admissible if and only if—
(a) it is important explanatory evidence
(b) it has substantial probative value in relation to a matter which—
(i) is a matter in issue in the proceedings, and
(ii) is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole
or
(c) all parties to the proceedings agree to the evidence being admissible.
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a) evidence is important explanatory evidence if—
(a) without it, the court or jury would find it impossible or difficult properly to understand other evidence in the case, and
(b) its value for understanding the case as a whole is substantial.
(3) In assessing the probative value of evidence for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant)—
(a) the nature and number of the events, or other things, to which the evidence relates;
(b) when those events or things are alleged to have happened or existed;
...
(4) Except where subsection (1)(c) applies, evidence of the bad character of a person other than the defendant must not be given without leave of the court.""
17.
Mr Claxton, for the appellant, first submits that the convictions of Mr White do not satisfy the conditions of
section 100(1)(b)
. He submits that the evidence of Mr White's convictions do not have ""substantial probative value"" in relation to a matter which is in issue in the proceeding and it is not of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole. Mr White's convictions are only relevant to one matter; that is, whether he was telling the truth about the fact or possibility that the appellant was at his house helping him repair a motorbike from about 12 noon to 4 or 5pm on 13 November 2009.
18.
This is certainly a matter which is in issue in the proceedings and that matter is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole. After all, if the jury thought that the alibi might be true, they would have had to acquit.
19.
Therefore the emphasis must be on whether those convictions of Mr White have ""substantial probative value"" in relation to whether he was telling the truth about the fact or possibility of the appellant being with him at the time the burglary was committed. Mr Claxton in this context reminds us of the remarks of Pitchford LJ in
R v Brewster and Cromwell
[2010] 2 Cr App R 20
at paragraph 23, where the learned Lord Justice said that the questions are: is the creditworthiness of the witness an issue of substantial importance; and is the bad character relied upon of substantial probative value in relation to that issue?
20.
In our judgment, the creditability of Mr White's evidence on the alibi is of substantial importance in the trial as a whole. Therefore, the question is whether those convictions are of ""substantive probative value"" in relation to that issue. In order to decide that, the judge had to have regard to the factors that are set out in
section 100(3)
. The judge did not say in terms in his ruling that he had had regard to those factors. However, we are satisfied that it is clear that, broadly speaking, he did so.
21.
The nature and number of those ""events"" are 53 convictions for offences of dishonesty over a period from 1978 to 1996. Some 12 of those offences, occurring over the period 1980 to 1996, were, it appears from the antecedents list, for obtaining by deception, forgery and using false instruments. All of those offences must have involved some form of untruthfulness by White, whether in words or deeds. Mr Claxton conceded that much before us.
22.
The judge said that he recognised the distinction between offences of dishonesty and the issue of untruthfulness, although he did not go on to say how that should be reflected in the decision that he had to make in relation to the admission of these convictions. The judge did recognise that all those convictions were within the period 1978 to 1996, but he did not distinguish between when the convictions for ""untruthfulness"" occurred, or what those particular offences were, or whether those ""untruthfulness"" offences were the subject of guilty or not guilty pleas.
23.
The offences of ""untruthfulness"", by which we include obtaining property by deception, using forged instruments and forgery, were, as we have noted, committed between 1980 and 1996. In particular, we note that in 1990 Mr White was put on probation for 18 months for two offences of forgery and three of using a false instrument under the
Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981
, and in 1996 he was put on probation for two years for obtaining property by deception. We do not have any further details of those offences and it does not appear that the judge did either.
24.
Perhaps because the judge did not have details of those offences, he did not consider at all the matter of the similarities and dissimilarities between those offences and what Mr White was alleged to have done or be about to do in this case, viz to give a false statement and to lie on oath that the appellant was with him on 13 November 2009. The judge should have done that comparison to see if the similarity was such that it demonstrated that there was a substantial probative value in the convictions (or some of them) of Mr White, in relation to the truthfulness or otherwise of his proposed alibi evidence.
25.
In our judgment, the judge failed properly to make a full assessment of the probative value or otherwise of the convictions of Mr White to see if they did have a substantial probative value in relation to the matter of his proposed evidence concerning alibi of the appellant. However, we have also concluded that if he had done this exercise, he would have been bound to conclude that the convictions which related to ""untruthfulness"", i.e. those of obtaining property by deception, forgery and using false instruments, did have substantial probative value in relation to his proposed evidence concerning the alibi of the appellant. Therefore the judge would have been bound to permit those to be adduced as ""non-defendant bad character"" evidence. However, we conclude that he would not have permitted the adduction of the remaining convictions.
26.
The question, therefore, is whether the introduction of irrelevant convictions and the failure to give any direction to the jury on how they should approach the issue of Mr White's credibility and his evidence in the light of those convictions which were admitted in evidence, makes this conviction unsafe.
27.
The fact that the iPod was recovered from the appellant's possessions two days after the burglary was powerful evidence against him. We are unimpressed by the submission that the appellant's explanation of the purchase from the beggar was credible. We are quite satisfied that a jury would have regarded that explanation as incredible.
28.
Mr Claxton submitted that there were difficulties about the evidence of Mr Jones, the foot imprint specialist. Mr Claxton pointed out that Mr Jones had said that the evidence relating to the footprint was ""moderately strong support"" for the proposition that the appellant's shoe had made the imprint on the envelopes. Mr Claxton told us that, in cross-examination, Mr Jones had said that this expression reflected a statistical probability of the footprint having been made by the shoes of the appellant which was considerably more than a 50 per cent probability, because the linguistic phrases used, such as ""weak or limited support"" or ""extremely strong support"", were based on probability which was itself based on a logarithmic scale.
29.
In connection with this point, Mr Claxton referred us to statements of Thomas LJ in
R v T (Footwear mark evidence)
[2011] 1 Cr App R 9
at paras 73 and 74 in particular. Thomas LJ, giving the reserved judgment of the court, stated that if a footwear examiner expressed a view that went beyond saying that the footwear could or could not make the mark concerned, the report should make it clear that the view is subjective and based on experience of the examiner, so that words such as ""scientific"" used in making evaluations should not in fact be used because they would, before a jury, give an impression of a degree of precision and objectivity which is not present given the current state of expertise. The factors that the expert does use should, however, be set out and explained.
30.
In the present case, the evidence was that Mr Jones had worked as a scientist in this area since 1982 and had been involved in numerous cases concerned with footwear analysis and comparison of footprints. His evidence was that this footprint was in agreement with the size, pattern, detailed alignment and degree of wear with the trainer of the appellant that had been seized from him upon arrest. The zigzag bar pattern and the curved tramline were similar, and the trainers, which were size 9, were consistent with the footprint which was of size 9 or 8 but not size 10. Mr Jones' evidence was that he encountered the type of footwear seized from the appellant in only 2 per cent of cases that he dealt with as a forensic examiner of footwear and footprints. He also said that burglars frequently used sports trainers.
31.
In our view, the evidence of the expert did not transgress in any way the guidelines set down by this court in
R v T
. Mr Jones' evidence was based on his experience, and he gave his evidence in a manner which enabled the jury to make a decision on whether or not they were sure that those footprints were made by the appellant's trainers.
32.
In addition to that scientific evidence, there was the fact that the three occupants of the house did not use the front door habitually to get in and out; they used the back door.
33.
In addition, there was the supporting evidence of the failure of the appellant to mention at the time of charge and caution either the alibi or how he got the iPod. Indeed neither was mentioned in the defence case statement. Mr Claxton pointed out that the prosecution knew of the proposed alibi defence and Mr White's proposed evidence at the time of the first PCMH, and that the prosecution also knew the evidence about the purchase of the iPod at an early stage. But the fact remains that the appellant was not prepared to put those in a formal document until a much later stage in the proceedings.
34.
As noted, the question we have to ask is whether this conviction is safe despite the fact that the judge wrongly admitted all 53 convictions of Mr White as ""non-defendant bad character"" evidence and failed to give the jury any direction on how to approach Mr White's evidence in the light of that back character evidence of all his previous convictions.
35.
We have, after analysis and consideration, come to the very clear conclusion that this conviction was entirely safe. There was powerful evidence against the appellant in the form of the recent possession of the iPod, the incredible story of the purchase of it and the footmark on the envelopes at the front door where the burglar had broken in. In support, there was the failure to mention the alibi defence or the purchase of the iPod at the charge and caution stage. There was the late introduction of those two aspects, and the properly admitted evidence of the appellant's previous convictions for burglary.
36.
Therefore we must dismiss this appeal.","citation:

1.
LORD JUSTICE HOOPER: The Attorney-General seeks leave to refer to the Court of Appeal a sentence which is said to be unduly lenient. We grant that leave.
2.
The offender is Michael Madden. He is 31 years old. On 21st March 2007 he was found guilty of wounding with intent, contrary to
section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
. The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. On 3rd May 2007 the offender was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment by Miss Recorder Danji, sitting at Bradford Crown Court.
3.
In summary, on Sunday 22nd January 2006, the offender and the victim were drinking in a public house in Huddersfield. A fight broke out inside the pub, although it did not involve the victim. Both the offender and the victim came to be on the pavement outside the public house. The offender armed himself with a 12-inch carving knife and used this to stab the victim in the face in a downward motion. We have seen the photograph: it was a deep slashing wound to the side of the nose. There is no doubt, and this is not disputed, that the attack was entirely unprovoked.
4.
The facts in more detail are as follows:
(i) On the evening of 22nd January 2006 the victim, Joseph Rainey, went to Huddersfield and met up with two friends. He drank four pints of lager in two different public houses before the three men went to the ""Ivy Green"" public house at about 10.00pm. While there he drank a fifth pint. He considered that he was sober and stated that this was not a large amount for him to drink.
(ii) When he went to order a further pint, the barmaid asked if he was with 'the other two' referring to his friends. He confirmed that he was and she declined to serve him. As he went to leave the public house he made his way past a group of men who were fighting and went outside onto the pavement.
(iii) The victim noticed the offender approaching him along the pavement. The offender swung at him with his arm, connecting with the victim's nose and he felt a great deal of pain. In fact he had been stabbed and his nose began to bleed heavily.
(iv) An independent witness, Anne Hirst, saw the offender walk towards the pub carrying a large carving knife with a 12' blade. She saw him raise his knife above his head and attack the victim, striking him in a downward direction to his face.
(v) The victim describes how he moved away, but was followed by the offender who continued to challenge him to fight. He phoned the police who arrived swiftly.
(vi) Anne Hirst saw the offender being arrested by the police. She later identified the offender at an identification parade.
(vii) Two independent witnesses, Peggy Callaghan and Pauline Cadogan, who were passing in a car saw a man walking away holding a knife with a 12"" blade concealed behind his back. Neither they nor the victim were able to identify the offender.
(viii) The victim received a 6cm laceration to the left nostril and septum of his nose. He went to Huddersfield Hospital where he received emergency treatment including 12 sutures administered in two layers, one internally and one externally.
(ix) The offender declined to answer questions when first interviewed on 23rd January 2006. He was re-interviewed on 22nd September 2006, when he admitted that he had been involved in a disturbance, claimed that he had been assaulted and then declined to 'go into any more detail'. He denied carrying or using a knife.
(x) The offender has two previous convictions. The first is for an offence of wounding contrary to
section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
, on 25th June 1996. The second is criminal damage on 22nd October 2002. The facts of the 1996 wounding were described to the sentencing court by prosecution counsel as follows:
""The offender had been outside a public house when he hit a man on the head with a bottle. The bottle did not break but the blow knocked the victim to the ground. The offender then punched him repeatedly in the face. The victim suffered a cut to the rear of his head and to his lip.""
We note that the offender was in the Army at the time of the
section 20
offence.
5.
The offender continued to deny his role in the offence to the author of the pre-sentence report. He claimed that the victim and his friends were troublemakers and, while he accepted fighting, he had no recollection of hitting the victim. He continued to deny that he had ever carried or used a knife. The author concluded that the offender posed a medium risk of harm. No mitigation was advanced suggesting the victim himself had provoked the attack.
6.
In the submission of the Attorney-General there are four aggravating features:
(i) The offence was to some degree a premeditated attack, in which the offender used a knife, which he had no lawful excuse for possessing.
(ii) The offender raised the knife above his head and struck the victim in the face, where it was likely to cause significant and lasting damage.
(iii) The attack was unprovoked, late at night, and in a public place.
(iv) The offender has a previous conviction for unlawful wounding in similar circumstances.
We agree.
7.
The following mitigating features are, in our view, present. First, the offender has served in the British Army and has served his country well in Bosnia and other places. We have been provided with a number of excellent character references. Those who write the references speak highly of the offender, both as a soldier and as a human being. In one of the references it is said:
""If it was not for the fact that Pte Madden was leaving the Army to pursue a Civilian Career, I do believe that in a few years he would have made a strong and robust JNCO.""
8.
Another reference written by a Major refers to Private Madden as ""a fine soldier, by far the best in the company and one of the most talented I have worked with.""
9.
Another testimonial states in part:
""As an Infantryman he has demonstrated the ability to work in conditions of personal discomfort, often in difficult and sometimes dangerous circumstances. In all situations he has proved to be reliable and dependable. He has the ability to successfully absorb detailed theoretical information and perform important practical skills as part of a team.""
He is described as ""robust, fit, with strong leadership ability and a degree of technical aptitude.""
10.
It is also important to note in mitigation that there has been almost a period of 10 years between the serious offence of violence to which we have referred and this offence. The Attorney-General draws our attention to the case of
Attorney-General's Reference No 18 of 2002
(Christopher Simon Hughes)
[2003] 1 Cr App R(S) 9
and particularly at paragraph 21, where the then Vice-President, Rose LJ, said that the sentences for offences against
section 18
involving a knife, would normally be within the bracket of 3 to 8 years.
11.
We also looked at
Attorney-General's Reference No 138 of 2006
[2007] EWCA Crim 1077
. In that case the offender, who was aged 20, with no previous convictions and a good character, stabbed the victim twice, once in the right arm and once in the left side. The second blow was administered with such force that the knife became embedded in the bone and had to be surgically removed. In the view of the Court, the appropriate sentence, after a trial, would have been approaching 6 years' detention.
12.
In passing sentence on the offender in this case the judge said:
""You have been found guilty of unlawfully and maliciously wounding Joseph Rainey with the intent to do him grievous bodily harm. On 22nd January 2006, you used a knife to slash his nose causing a 6cm laceration as a result of which he required twelve stitches. As you know this is a serious offence. You caused very significant injury to the victim in the nature of the offence, namely street violence involving the use of a knife, is also one which the public are rightly very concerned about and the incident must also have caused distress and fear to those people who witnessed it.
I have taken into account what is known about what happened that evening including the fact that you too had been struck a blow. I have also noted the role that alcohol appears to have played in this offence and that you seem unable to recall exactly what happened, but that is, of course, no comfort to the victim or to the public, nor does it excuse what you did.
I have taken into account all that has been said in your favour in a pre-sentence report and in Court today in relation to the circumstances of the offence and in relation to your personal and your work life. I have also noted in your favour what has been said about your attempts to avoid further trouble since the offence by moving out of your area and that there have been no difficulties since the date of the offence. These factors do weigh in your favour. I have taken particular note of the dossier containing your qualifications and references. These are clearly quite a large number of people who think very highly of you and some of the references, particularly from your time in the Armed Forces, are excellent. I have taken these into account in your favour but would also venture to say that it is a great shame for someone with your skills and potential to engage in criminal behaviour regardless of the circumstances and I very much hope you will conduct yourself in the future so as not to come before these Courts ever again.
It seems to me that alcohol has played a significant part in this offence and I am surprised by the indication in the pre-sentence report that you are comfortable with your level of alcohol intake. I think this is something you ought to seriously rethink if you want to build a kind of positive life which people who know you best seem to think you are capable of. In considering the appropriate sentence I have taken into account your two previous convictions for offences. In particular the offence involving violence although I have taken into account, also, that that was over ten years ago. I do not propose to invoke the dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Justice Act because I do not consider that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by further specified offences being committed by you.
Nevertheless, as I am sure you have been told, your offence is so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified. It is unavoidable that you must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. This will be the very shortest which, in my opinion, matches the serious and circumstances of your offence and takes into account all the mitigating factors. The sentence I pass is one of three years' imprisonment.""
13.
It is submitted that the sentence is unduly lenient having regard to the aggravating features of the case to which we have made reference. It is said that the sentence failed to reflect the gravity of the offence and the public concern about offences of this nature.
14.
Mr Mairs, who appears for the offender, accepts that the attack was unprovoked, although he refers to the fact that there had been difficulty between two groups of people. Whether the victim was a member of one of those groups is not clear. Mr Mairs mentions that only to try to explain why the offender, given his record in the Army and the references to which we have referred, might have resorted to violence on this occasion.
15.
Mr Mairs also points out that, although the injury was clearly a very serious injury, it was not of a life threatening character. It could, so he submits, have been far more serious than it was. He submits that we are entitled to take into account that the injuries were not as serious as they otherwise could easily have been.
16.
It is submitted by Mr Fenhalls, on behalf of the Attorney-General, that the proper sentence in this case would have been in the region of 6 years' imprisonment. We agree with that submission. We quash the sentence that was passed and, giving a small discount for double jeopardy, we substitute for it a sentence of five-and-a-half years' imprisonment.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE LEWIS:  The provisions of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 apply to this offence.  Consequently, where a sexual offence has been committed against a person, no matter relating to that person shall, during that person’s lifetime, be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify that person as the victim of the offence.
2.
On 17 April 2023, in the Crown Court at St Albans, the applicant, Lee Hammill (then aged 31), was convicted of a number of offences.  Two were offences of rape of a child under the age of 13. Two were offences of assault of a child under 13 by digital penetration and two similar offences by penetration with his tongue.  Nine others were offences of sexual activity with a child.  The applicant was sentenced to a total of 12 years, comprising a custodial term of 11 years and an additional 1-year licence period.  The applicant’s application for leave to appeal against conviction was refused by the single judge.  He renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction.
3.
The facts can be stated shortly.  The complainant was a child whom we will refer to as “AB”.  A member of her family was in a relationship with the applicant.  The prosecution alleged that from the age of 11 to 14, the applicant penetrated AB’s vagina with his fingers and his tongue, and anally raped her on two occasions.  When AB was between the ages of 13 and 14, the applicant was again accused of penetrating her vagina with his fingers and his tongue and, on occasions, penetrating her anus with his penis.
4.
The prosecution relied upon evidence from AB.  There was also evidence from others including AB’s first partner.  The applicant also gave evidence.  He has autism and very shortly before he gave evidence it was decided that he would have an intermediary to assist him.  The applicant denied that any sexual activity had occurred between him and AB.  AB’s mother also gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution.  She in fact said that AB had made it all up and she was cross-examined and asked questions in re-examination by the prosecution.  It is clear, having read all the material put before us, that the central issue in the case was whether the prosecution had made the jury sure that each alleged event on each count had in fact happened.
5.
On behalf of the applicant, Ms Roberson has made very detailed, very clear and very helpful written and oral submissions.  She advanced four grounds of appeal.  Grounds 1 and 2 can be taken together, but it is important to remember that that Ms Roberson submits that the grounds individually but also cumulatively give rise to questions about the safety of the conviction.
6.
In relation to ground 1, Ms Roberson submits that the Recorder usurped the role of the jury by making repeated pro prosecution comments in the summing-up.  Ms Roberson has set them all out in her detailed skeleton argument.  She took us through a number of those, drawing attention in particular to items in paragraph 9 of her written argument and to what are said to be improper comments set out in paragraph 17 of her skeleton argument, drawing attention to some of those points in particular.Ms Roberson relied upon the decision in
R v Mears
[1993] 1 WLR 818 that, if a summing-up is fundamentally imbalanced, it cannot be corrected simply by the judge telling the jury that the assessment of the evidence was a matter for them.  Alternatively, in relation to ground 2, Ms Roberson submits that the Recorder gave a summary of evidence that was so diffuse and unstructured as to be of no assistance to the jury.
7.
Ground 3 is that the judge failed to allow the intermediary to assist the applicant to the best of her abilities during his evidence.  Again, in her written submissions and orally, Ms Roberson took us through the various examples that she submitted exhibited those errors.  She pointed out that the ground rules hearing, by which the rules relating to how the evidence was going to be taken from the applicant, had not been done in a way that met the recommendations of the Advocate’s Toolkit.  The applicant did not have the ground rules hearing until shortly before he gave evidence even though Ms Roberson had asked for a ground rules hearing on the previous day.  After 90 minutes the applicant stopped giving evidence and then, over a period of time, counsel reformulated his questions to make them more comprehensible by the applicant but, by that stage, Ms Roberson submitted that it was too late and the impact of the 90 minutes could not be minimised because the applicant would by then have felt confused.  She submitted that the judge overruled the intermediary at a number of points.  Not, it seems, expressly turning down anything the intermediary says but rather when the intermediary said something or raised her hand in an attempt to assist the applicant, Ms Roberson submitted that the Recorder effectively ignored the intermediary.  There had been a recommendation for breaks at periodical intervals.  There had not been a break.  The intermediary requested a break but one was refused and the taking of evidence from the applicant continued.
8.
Ground 4 concerns the fact that Ms Roberson submitted that the Recorder erred by allowing the prosecution to cross-examine their own witnesses.  That is a reference to AB’s mother in particular, although it is said the error occurred in relation to AB’s father in evidence as well.  In relation to AB’s mother, two particular points that Ms Roberson made was that the prosecution, in re-examination, was allowed to ask whether the mother had said in the written statement that she made to the police that her daughter had made it all up, and the mother said it was something she had told the police but the policeman had not written it down. Ms Roberson submits that although it was not expressly said by the prosecution, it is implicit, or the inference was, that the mother was making that part of her evidence up.  The second point concerned re-examination on the question of timings and the time at which AB ceased to live at the parental home and went to live with her partner.  There was an issue as to whether she had simply stayed with her partner from Christmas onwards and moved in with him in February, or whether she had in effect moved out of the family home in December.
9.
We have read very carefully all the material submitted to us for this hearing, including the entirety of the summing-up and the transcripts of the re-examination of AB’s mother.  We have also read the transcripts of the cross-examination and re-examination of the applicant, and we have read the autism spectrum disorder assessment and the intermediary report, although the intermediary at the hearing was a different one from the one who made the report.
10.
We remind ourselves that the question for this Court in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal is whether the conviction is arguably unsafe.  Having read the transcript of the summing-up in its entirety, we do not consider that it demonstrates that the Recorder usurped the role of the jury.  The summing-up went through the Route to Verdict document explaining what the jury had to be sure of before they could convict the applicant on each of the counts.  The Recorder reminded the jury that the applicant was of good character, which supported his credibility and made it less likely that he had committed the offences.  The central issue in the case was whether or not the jury were sure that the conduct alleged in each count had in fact happened.
11.
The Recorder summarised the evidence of AB.  She also summarised the evidence given by the applicant.  She set out his answers, including those where he said he had never shared a bed with AB or massaged her.  He had never put his fingers or his tongue in her vagina and he said he had never put his penis in her anus.  That was what the jury had to assess.  It is correct that the Recorder said once, in the course of the transcript of the summing-up that “we suggest”, when, of course, it was the prosecution who was bringing the case and making submissions.  The judge was not suggesting anything.  The judge was presiding over the trial.  The Recorder did however correct herself.  We do not regard this error, unfortunate though it was, as demonstrating that the summing-up was fundamentally biased.  Nor do we think that the summing-up was so diffuse or unstructured as to be of no assistance to the jury.  Reading the summing-up as a whole and fairly, it was clear what the jury had to decide and what the central issues were, namely whether or not they were sure that the events in each of the counts had happened. They were told what the evidence was and what the defence case was.  Grounds 1 and 2 do not arguably demonstrate that the conviction was unsafe.
12.
In relation to ground 3 and the intermediary, we make the following observations.  Intermediaries are important in a criminal trial.  They assist vulnerable witnesses to give their evidence in the best way possible.  It is important that consideration be given to how the arrangements are going to be operated and what needs to be done to enable the intermediary to function properly and to give his or her assistance to the witness.  There are recommendations which deal with that.
13.
Dealing with the criticism advanced here.  The first concerns the fact that the arrangements did not provide for a ground rules hearing before or adequately before the start of the trial.  That is obviously important because it allows people to focus and preparation to be made on the basis of how the intermediary is going to operate.  However, we have to bear in mind the question here is the safety of the convictions. The fact of the matter is that a ground rules hearing was held shortly before the applicant gave evidence. The intermediary who was going to be present and acting as the intermediary at the trial did highlight certain points that she thought were important and which we understand were agreed to be the points that needed to be taken into account.  They were that there were to be breaks to be taken every 40 minutes for 15 minutes, the appellant was to be reminded that he was not guessing, there be short and specific questions, common language was to be used, counsel was to avoid dates and refer to events instead, counsel was to signpost topic changes and these were to be ordered chronologically wherever possible, additional processing time should be allowed for the applicant to process the question and advocates were to speak slowly.  Despite the criticism therefore of the timing of the holding of the ground rules hearing, it was held and the relevant points that the intermediary wanted brought out were brought out.
14.
In terms of the report that had been prepared, that did refer to questions being written out.  But, as far as we can see, that was not something that the intermediary raised on the day.  There is no ground of appeal in relation to that and no complaint about that matter is made in the written skeleton argument.
15.
So far as the starting of the cross-examination and the first 90 minutes is concerned, the position was this.  Prosecution counsel has said that he had begun cross-examination without having time to rework his questions.  In fact, he did rework his questions over the Easter weekend break.  No examples were shown to us, where, in our judgment, on a fair reading of the transcript, the applicant was unable to give his evidence.  On the question of the breaks, that came towards the end of the cross-examination.  It was apparent there was a short time left and, when it was raised, the applicant indicated he did not want a break and he could, and did in fact, continue to give evidence without apparent difficulty.  He also confirmed that the question and answers that he had given in response to the police interview were correct and the jury had that material as well.
16.
We do not see any evidence that the judge overruled the intermediary, and in all the circumstances, reading the transcripts fairly, and considering the effect of what happened, we do not consider that it is arguable that the way in which the intermediary was dealt with gives rise to an arguable ground that the conviction was unsafe.
17.
On ground 4, having read the examination and the re-examination, it seems to us that what happened in re-examination was that the Crown had confirmed with the witness that the reference to the witness’s daughter having made these allegations up was not in the statement and the witness explained why.  She said she had given the information to the police but the policeman had not written it down. That was a matter for the jury to assess.
18.
So far as the timing in relation to when AB moved out - was it Christmas or was it technically later in February? -we do not see that that matter could possibly affect the safety of the conviction, whether or not it was a question that should have been asked.  So we do not see that ground 4 raises any arguable issue of the safety of the conviction.
19.
Standing back from the four individual grounds of appeal, we have considered the four grounds cumulatively to see whether the effect of what Ms Roberson criticised has arguably rendered this conviction unsafe.  We are satisfied that the errors that she says occurred do not in fact make an arguable case that the conviction was unsafe.  For those reasons, we refuse leave to appeal.
20.
We understand that maybe disappointing for the family.  We thank them for the dignity they have shown in Court as they have listened to what must be a difficult judgment and we are grateful to Ms Roberson, for her written argument and helpful oral arguments.

1.
MR JUSTICE DAVIS: The appellant, Paiwand Asi-Akram, is now 18 years old but at the relevant times for the purposes of this appeal was 17. On 27th October 2004, in the Crown Court at Derby before His Honour Judge Hamilton, he pleaded guilty, on rearraignment, to three particular counts on an indictment: the first two counts, counts 1 and 2, being counts of rape and the third matter, count 4 on the indictment, being a count of attempting to choke, suffocate or strangle with intent to commit an indictable offence (being rape) contrary to
section 21 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
. He was sentenced on each of these counts to 14 years' detention. The judge exercised his powers under
section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000
, the appellant being under the age of 18 at the relevant time. The judge in fact expressed himself as imposing a term of imprisonment but it is plain that he intended to impose a term of detention. In addition, the appellant was recommended for deportation and it was a consequence of the sentence that he was required to register indefinitely under the provisions of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
.
2.
It may perhaps be noted that in the initial stages of the argument before the judge he clearly had in mind the possibility of imposing an indeterminate sentence. The judge, however, was persuaded by counsel that, by reason of the appellant's then age, he had no power in law to impose an indeterminate sentence. It is now conceded before us that the judge did have such a power. The point now is academic. But we think it worth noting that the judge, at least initially, had that prospect in mind.
3.
Against the total sentence of 14 years' detention the appellant appeals, having obtained the leave of the Single Judge.
4.
The facts may be briefly stated for present purposes. They are, to say the least, disconcerting. In the early hours of the morning on a day between 26th December 2003 and 1st January 2004 a prostitute was working in Derby when she came across the appellant. He asked her how much she charged for full sex and oral sex and an agreement was reached that she would perform oral sex upon him for £10. They both went to some bushes but when she started to perform the sex act on him, he immediately became aggressive and demanded full intercourse. When she refused he became violent, forced her to the ground, placed both hands round her neck and got on top of her. He then pulled her clothes off, placed his hand over her mouth so that nobody would hear her screams and then forcefully penetrated her vagina with his penis. So violent was he that she genuinely believed she was going to die. He ejaculated inside her without wearing a condom. After that, he asked her to accompany him home but when she refused he raped her again in exactly the same manner and then ran off.
5.
She did not make a complaint to the police initially, because she feared she would not be believed because of her vocation. In the end she did make a complaint when she heard on the grapevine that another woman had been assaulted in a similar way, in the same area of Derby.
6.
That other victim was approached by the appellant in the early hours of the morning of 11th January 2004 as she walked towards a shop. He tried to engage her in conversation and asked her if she did business. She replied that she did not, but he followed her into the shop, followed her out again and persisted in his conversation with her, making her feel uncomfortable. When they reached some bushes, he produced a knife, grabbed her by the arm, pulled her into the bushes and pushed her to the ground. When she tried to get up, he pushed her down again and at this point she pleaded with him repeatedly to stop and told him she was frightened that he would kill her. He then pulled her trousers off and used the knife to cut away her underwear. After that, despite her kicks aimed at him, he got on top of her, pinned her down, placed one hand round her neck and pressed hard down with it so that she had difficulty in breathing. The more she struggled by trying to scratch him, the greater the pressure he exerted on her windpipe. She passed out momentarily and the next thing she recalled was him vaginally raping her, placing his finger inside her anus and trying to kiss her. He did not use any condom. He turned her over to change position, and as he did this, she grabbed her opportunity to run off, leaving most of her clothing behind. She ran to a group of her friends who were nearby and told them what had happened.
7.
Both victims subsequently identified the appellant at identity parades. So far as the second victim was concerned, DNA materials in semen and also by reference to skin under her fingernails were found, implicating the appellant.
8.
Shortly after this second attack, the appellant left Derby and made his way to Teesside. In the early hours of the morning on 23rd January 2004, he approached a prostitute in Middlesbrough. An agreement was reached whereby he would pay her £10 to perform oral sex upon him. They walked down an alleyway and the victim produced a condom which she placed on him and she then started to perform oral sex upon him. However, as with the previous two incidents, he became aggressive and violent and demanded full intercourse. Initially she agreed to do that for a further £10. When she asked for the extra money he became extremely violent. He grabbed her by neck and pulled her to the ground, in a headlock. She asked him to leave her alone but his response was to say that he was going to kill her if she did not do what she was told. She was terrified. He placed both hands round her neck and began strangling her as she shouted for help. She tried to poke his eye but he banged her head on the ground, knocking her unconscious. By the time she came round the police had arrived. As it happened the police had been alerted by a man who lived nearby, who had heard groaning noises in the alley behind his home. When that man went out to investigate, he saw the appellant leaning over the victim, punching her and grabbing at her with both hands.
9.
When the police arrived the appellant was standing a short distance from her, with his trousers and underwear around his buttocks. The victim was initially motionless and blood was coming from her head. In the event she came round quite quickly although it is clear that she was disorientated as a result of what had happened. She was taken to hospital for treatment for her injuries. This Court has seen photographs of the injuries to the last two victims. They are unpleasant.
10.
When the appellant was arrested and interviewed he said that he had beaten the third victim after she demanded that he pay for sex with her, had stolen some money from him and then attacked him. He claimed that he had beaten her in self-defence. As to the first two attacks, he maintained that he knew nothing about those at all.
11.
Before the sentencing judge was a psychiatric report which had been obtained. That noted that there were certain difficulties in making an assessment because of the appellant's poor grasp of the English language (the appellant is by birth an Iraqi Kurd). The report, understandably, dealt in some detail on what appear to have been significant traumatic experiences suffered by the appellant whilst in Iraq and before he came to the United Kingdom. In the course of the report, the psychiatrist noted this:
""Most vigorously and repeatedly he protested his complete innocence with regard to all the index charges.""
The psychiatrist noted that he presented as a very sullen young man, and that he had certainly no delusions as to guilt and, on the contrary, that he saw himself as a good person. He was distraught that no one seemed to believe in his innocence. The psychiatrist concluded that there was no evidence of any psychopathic or personality disorder, although the appellant was likely to have been traumatised by his past experiences in Iraq. We might add that since sentence was passed a prison report has been obtained. That reports on the appellant in terms which, it has to be said, are generally unfavourable and records instances of him threatening other inmates.
12.
In the course of his sentencing remarks, the judge indicated that, in terms of appearance, the appellant seemed to him to be more likely to be something in the region of 22 years old or thereabouts: although the judge made it clear that he sentenced the appellant as a 17 year old and one who had never before committed any criminal acts. The judge then dealt with the mitigation, including age; referred to the psychiatric report; dealt with the facts of the case; and then said this:
""You are, in my view, a very great danger to women and, as I have already said, only a very substantial term of imprisonment is appropriate.""
The judge acknowledged the plea of guilty that had been tendered and then proceeded to impose a sentence of 14 years' detention in total, as already noted, as well as recommending the appellant for deportation.
13.
Mr Lody, who appears on behalf of the appellant today as he did in the court below, does not in the course of his realistic submissions in any way seek to minimise the seriousness of this offending, which he rightly described as ""dreadful"". Mr Lody does not seek to dispute the judge's finding that the appellant is a danger to women. Mr Lody expressly accepted that there is a high level risk of repeat offending. Further, Mr Lody does not dispute that a campaign of rape of this kind indicated a starting point, after a contested trial, of 15 years, having regard to the guidelines given in the case of
R v Millberry
[2003] 1 Cr App R(S) 25
.
14.
Mr Lody, however, submits that a custodial sentence of 14 years is of an order which, he suggests, one would expect (assuming that is, as he does, that a life sentence was not to be imposed) in the case of an adult offender, even allowing for the plea. We would very much query whether a judge (assuming he passed a determinate sentence) would be restricted to a sentence of a maximum of 14 years for an adult, given the circumstances. But that, at all events, was the submission of Mr Lody.
15.
In particular, Mr Lody emphasises the observations of the Court of Appeal in
Millberry
at paragraph 30, where in dealing with young offenders the Court of Appeal said that, like the Sentencing Panel, it concluded that a sentence should be ""significantly shorter for young offenders"". Mr Lody emphasises this point: although he does also add to it the point that the appellant did plead guilty at what the judge accepted was to be regarded as the earliest practical stage and thereby spared the victims from the ordeal of having to give evidence. But Mr Lody's real point is the age of this particular appellant.
16.
We should perhaps add, by reference to
Millberry
, that a little further on in the judgment the Court of Appeal stressed that the Court should not adopt a merely mechanistic approach to guidelines and should look at all the circumstances in the round.
17.
These were indeed very grave offences: in our view, amongst the very worst of their kind. The appellant showed complete disregard for the victims in each case. Extensive and gratuitous violence was used in each case. In the first case the rape was repeated. In the second, which is perhaps the most serious of all, a knife was produced and used to cut the victim's clothing. There was an attempt to strangle her. In the third case, again there was an attempt to strangle and the violence lasted for a significant period. In all cases quite significant injury was caused. Inevitably all three of the women victims were absolutely terrified; inevitably all three of them feared for their lives.
18.
Quite apart from this being a campaign of rape, directed by the appellant at prostitutes, or women whom he regarded as prostitutes, there were here, therefore, significant aggravating features which by reference to the putative starting point, had also to be taken into account. Further, the appellant is, as Mr Lody accepts, a danger to women. The psychiatric report seem to indicate that he has no regard for his victims and indeed the impression one rather gets is that that appellant seems somehow to have contrived to persuade himself that it is he who is in some way the victim. There is no doubt, in our view, that the judge was justified in imposing a very significant sentence indeed given the circumstances.
19.
But there remains the matter of the appellant's age. As we have said, the judge and the prosecution were prepared to accept that the appellant was 17 at the relevant times. The question then is whether that particular matter was sufficiently reflected in the total sentence which the judge imposed.
20.
In our judgment, the observation of this Court in
Millberry
at paragraph 30, that in the rape cases the sentence should, in the case of young offenders, be ""significantly shorter"" than otherwise be the case of adults is a broadly general observation, which nevertheless admits of exceptions. It was not, in our judgment, designed to be one of invariable and inevitable application. In all such cases youth will always be a relevant consideration. But the extent to which it calls for a reduction (and, specifically, a ""significant"" reduction), by comparison to a sentence which otherwise would have been passed on an adult, nevertheless remains to be assessed by the sentencing court by reference to the circumstances of the case. There are cases of rape where the youth of the defendant can be said, in one sense at least, to play an operative part in the offence. But this most emphatically is not such a case. We bear in mind, too, that there may be greater prospects of rehabilitation in the case of younger offenders as compared to older and perhaps more hardened offenders. We do also bear in mind the point, well made by Mr Lody, that it is a particularly daunting matter, as far as a young person is concerned, if a very long sentence is imposed.
21.
However, as against that, in this particular case there is to be borne in mind the very important consideration that, in the context of a campaign of particularly nasty and violent rapes, the appellant was found by the judge (and as is accepted) to be a serious danger to women. Overall, while the sentence may have been a severe one, in our view it was justifiably so. We dismiss this appeal.","citation:

    Exact: The facts may be briefly stated for present purposes. They are, to say the least, disconcerting. In the early hours of the morning on a day between 26th December 2003 and 1st January 2004 a prostitute was working in Derby when she came across the appellant. He asked her how much she charged for full sex and oral sex and an agreement was reached that she would perform oral sex upon him for £10. They both went to some bushes but when she started to perform the sex act on him, he immediately became aggressive and demanded full intercourse. When she refused he became violent, forced her to the ground, placed both hands round her neck and got on top of her. He then pulled her clothes off, placed his hand over her mouth so that nobody would hear her screams and then forcefully penetrated her vagina with his penis. So violent was he that she genuinely believed she was going to die. He ejaculated inside her without wearing a condom. After that, he asked her to accompany him home but when she refused he raped her again in exactly the same manner and then ran off.

J U D G M E N T
THE PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION:
1.
This is the resumed hearing of the appeal by Anthony Appleyard against his conviction at a court martial held in December 2004 at Catterick. On Wednesday of last week, 12 October 2005, we rejected the submission by Mr Gilbert Blades on his behalf that the directions given by the judge advocate on duress were defective. That conclusion was reached in the context of this particular case.
2.
We now turn to an argument of some importance to court martials generally. It arises in this way. In the course of the directions given by the Judge Advocate he told the members of the Board in express terms that on retirement they should ""try to reach a verdict upon which each one of you is agreed"". He went on that when it became possible for a majority verdict to be accepted he would give a further direction.
3.
Shortly before the Board retired he returned to this topic. He again directed the Board to try to reach a verdict on which they were all agreed and told them that they should not ""worry"" about majority verdicts at that stage. In due course, when the court martial re-convened, the judge advocate began by asking whether verdicts had been reached on all charges on which all members were agreed. The presiding officer said that they had.
4.
Mr Blades makes the short but stark submission that the convictions should be quashed, notwithstanding that each individual member of the Board was convinced of the appellant's guilt. He says that the directions by the Judge Advocate contravened
section 96
of the
Army Act 1955
. This provides that verdicts of a court martial ""shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members of the court"".
5.
In his oral submissions this morning Mr Blades pointed out that in one sense the arrangements for court martials in the military sphere were well ahead of
section 17
of the
Juries Act 1974
, which introduced majority verdicts in civilian cases. Mr Blades also sought to draw assistance from the Court Martial Army Rules 1997, rule 70(4) of which provides that the vote of each member of the court should be given in ""reverse order of seniority"". He suggested that there was a specific purpose for this provision. That was to avoid the risk that junior officers would be influenced, or improperly allow their views to be influenced, by the views of their superior officers whose orders in any other area of military life would be obeyed.
6.
On examination we find that the Judge Advocate directed the Board in terms that the vote of the most junior officer should be taken first, with the remaining votes delivered in ascending order of rank. There was, therefore, no misdirection on this point. Moreover, he further expressly directed that the court martial was not like the normal military situation and that in this context the view of each member of the Board was of equal value. In particular it was not for the presiding officer to make the decision. As the Judge Advocate said in unequivocal language, ""Everyone's view and opinion is equal"". That direction was entirely consistent with the briefing notes provided for the Board. Paragraph 31 of the 2002 edition of the Military Courts Guide provides:
""The President will normally initiate the discussion.... He should ensure that each member gives his opinion on finding in respect of each charge separately, in ascending order of seniority commencing with the junior member.""
There is nothing to suggest that this briefing note or the judge advocate's directions were ignored. The paragraph continues:
""A unanimous decision is preferable, but a majority of votes will decide the issue.""
That guidance is unequivocal. It is consistent with a recent direction given by His Honour Judge Jeff Blackett, the Judge Advocate General dated 30 November 2004. Practice Memorandum No: 1989 is entitled ""Court Martial -- Direction as to Unanimity"". It reads:
""I do not know whether all judge advocates at present routinely direct court-martial members to strive to reach a unanimous finding, but if this is not the uniform practice then I wish it to be so with immediate effect.""
The memorandum goes on to invite judge advocates to incorporate into their summing-up in each case an appropriately modified form of the specimen direction linked to Criminal Proceedings Consolidation.
7.
Without making any formal concessions, Mr Blades was prepared to accept that there may be a good deal of sense in these arrangements. He is concerned, first, that they nevertheless constitute a contravention of
section 96
, and, second, that while
section 96
remains on the statute books, any changes in the practice, however desirable, are matters to which Parliament should attend. He suggests that the Judge Advocate's direction in this case might produce a series of votes by the members of the Board and that if the result of the Board's first vote on each charge were not unanimous, further votes would have to be taken to achieve the unanimity suggested by the Judge Advocate. His written submissions suggest that in any second or subsequent vote the junior officers would be aware of the way in which the senior officers had voted and might be influenced by that knowledge. This would deprive the Court Martial of the essential requirement of impartiality.
8.
Although not essential to our decision, we pause to note that Mr Blades' written argument suggests that a junior officer would necessarily seek an acquittal while a more senior one would apparently be convinced of guilt. We do not know how this might work in practice. More important, however, the basic suggestion is not realistic. Any final determinative vote would come after a debate between the members of the Court Martial. It would be a pretty dull officer who would be unable to discern from the debate itself what the views of his colleagues, of whatever rank, would be likely to be and how, when it came to the final determinative vote, they would be likely to vote. That said, after the debate and after listening to the views of all his colleagues, the most junior officer at the Court Martial, and all its other members, too, will and can confidently be expected to vote as directed by conscience. As Lord Bingham of Cornhill observed in
R v Spear, Hastie and Boyd
and
R v Saunby and Others
[2003] 1 AC 734
, 752, after a speech in which all these issues were fully analysed:
""Officers will appreciate, better than anyone, that to convict and punish those not shown to be guilty is not to promote the interests of good discipline and high morale but to sow the seeds of disaffection and perhaps even mutiny. In the absence of any evidence at all to support it, I could not accept the suggestion that any modern officer would, despite the oath he has taken, exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so.""
9.
The argument by Mr Blades assumes that the Judge Advocate directed that there should be a series of formal or determinative votes culminating in a unanimous decision. We are unable to accept this premise. We assume that, like any other jury in the course of the debate, the presiding officer, like the foreman of the jury, might, if he or she thought fit, from time to time wish to take soundings to see how any potential votes might be cast. This exercise, if it took place, would not be a series of determinative votes. Thereafter, assuming that the presiding officer decided that a determinative vote should be taken, which, notwithstanding the Judge Advocate's direction, produced not a unanimous but a majority verdict, that would be the verdict which would be returned in due course after a majority direction had been received from the Judge Advocate, or after the presiding officer had sent a written indication to him that the Board was unable to reach the unanimous verdict he had asked them to try to reach. We are all familiar with these processes in the civilian criminal justice system. There is no reason to assume that members of a court martial would be likely to behave differently.
10.
In the end, with respect to Mr Blades' written submission, the Human Rights Act and the challenge that the direction given by the Judge Advocate that the Board should ""try"" to reach a unanimous verdict somehow deprived the court martial and its members of its and their independence and impartiality as a tribunal established by law does not withstand analysis.
11.
Our conclusion can be simply expressed. The Judge Advocate had no jurisdiction to refuse to accept a majority verdict from the Board. However, he was entitled to direct the members to seek or try to return a unanimous verdict if they could. That is what he did. A unanimous verdict is, indeed, preferable, if that is the verdict to which each member can conscientiously come. The direction given by the Judge Advocate did not produce a situation in which a majority of votes in favour of an acquittal (a majority verdict acquittal) would somehow have been rejected or treated as if it could not be returned. The Board would have been likely to have understood from the directions as a whole that if their efforts to reach a unanimous verdict failed, then in due course a majority verdict would be taken. For this purpose it would probably be better practice for any directions given to the Board on this topic to run along lines which expressly acknowledge that in the end the Board is entitled to return a majority verdict, but that it would be preferable for the Board to start its deliberations by seeking if possible to return a unanimous verdict. The directions in this case did not quite echo this suggested language. That said, we can see no justification for interfering with these verdicts and quashing the convictions. Accordingly, these appeals against conviction on this ground, too, are dismissed.
12.
We must now turn to issues of sentence. We shall not repeat the essential facts relating to these convictions which are set out in our earlier judgment. We simply record that the appellant was sentenced to 297 days' detention and reduced to the ranks. It was acknowledged by Mr Blades in his helpful submissions on behalf of the appellant that the most serious charge related to the attempts by the appellant to pervert the course of justice. However, he pointed out that the appellant had fourteen years' reckonable service without any previous civil or military charge. The reason for sentence provided by the judge advocate acknowledge that if the three offences relating to the DVDs had stood alone, a small financial penalty would have been appropriate. However, the Board was extremely concerned that a corporal had used his influence to try to persuade a young soldier of 17 years of age to tell lies and to become involved in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. The appellant was in a position of an instructor. He should have been giving guidance to young soldiers. In any event, therefore, his conduct represented a breach of trust to youngsters who might themselves have been put at the risk of criminal proceedings. The Board recognised the factors in mitigation, including the appellant's previous good character, his long-standing ambition to be a soldier and the service he had given, as well as his real personal difficulties at home.
13.
The Judge Advocate pointed out that the Board had seriously considered dismissal from the army at that stage, but concluded that a more merciful sentence should be imposed -- one which would not make the appellant unemployed or render his family homeless.
14.
Mr Blades submitted that the sentence was excessive. The reduction to the ranks followed from the order of detention, although the judge advocate indicated that, even without the sentence of detention, the appellant's convictions meant that he was no longer fit to be an NCO.
15.
We have considered Mr Blades' submission. It seems to us clear that the Board was profoundly concerned not only by the serious offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, but its potential impact on young soldiers. We share the concerns of the Board. We see no basis for interfering with the sentence.
16.
We turn to the second appeal against sentence only, which arose from the appellant's guilty pleas to two offences of indecent assault before a court martial held at Catterick in March 2005. On 4 April the appellant was sentenced to be dismissed from Her Majesty's Service, together with nine months' detention to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on 28 January 2005. We note, in addition, that the financial consequences of these orders would have been very significant. The appeal is brought by leave of the single judge.
17.
The facts can be summarised briefly. We note that a written basis of plea was prepared and, as far as we can see, accepted by the prosecution. By the time that the advocate for the prosecution had finished opening the case, it was necessary (and appropriate) for Mr Blades to remind the Court Martial of the existence of that written basis of plea and to invite the members to focus their attention on it.
18.
The facts of the case were that the appellant, then still a corporal, worked as an instructor. The complainant was an 18 year old female trainee, to whom the appellant paid an increasing amount of attention. He invited her to go out with him and left messages on her mobile phone for her. From time to time he would call her away from PT and march them back to their accommodation so that they could avoid doing PT which they did not enjoy very much. The appellant was twice the young woman's age.
19.
The first charge related to an incident which occurred in Hanger 1 after the complainant had been stood down from PT by the appellant. The agreed basis of plea reads that the two of them were in the hanger and that when the complainant was walking towards the lavatory the accused walked up behind her saying, ""Keep walking. I can't do anything to you because my wife is in the hanger"". He continued to follow her. When the coast was clear he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to a secluded place where they would be out of sight. There he put his arm around her waist, tried to pull her shirr out of her trousers, and kissed her neck. She then made an excuse about seeing another corporal. That was the end of the incident.
20.
The second occasion occurred a few days later in similar circumstances. The appellant told an NCO that the complainant was going to police the blocks with him to ensure that only those people with a valid reason to be there had remained in them. According to the complainant, she was reluctant to go into one of the rooms with the appellant who invited her to join him there, to shut the door and to stand beside him at the window to look at the snow. According to the agreed basis of plea, during the course of inspecting several blocks, the appellant touched the complainant several times on her bottom, kissed her lips, cheek and neck and pulled her shirt out of her trousers.
21.
The matter was not reported initially because the complainant did not wish to make trouble as she only had a few weeks of training left. The appellant continued to pester her. He invited her to his home when his wife was out. On one occasion he rang her fifteen times while she was unavailable because she was at the cinema. Because she felt that she could not get away from the appellant, the complainant then reported what had happened.
22.
In interview the appellant denied the offences, but he pleaded guilty on the agreed basis of plea which we have indicated.
23.
The significant criticisms of the sentence advanced by Mr Blades can be summarised briefly. First, and most important, it does not appear that sufficient attention was given to the written basis of plea which was accepted by the prosecution. Second, there was a possible misunderstanding about the impact of evidence about the way in which the complainant was seen to behave at a time when, it was common ground, she would have been inebriated. Mr Blades suggests that it was a legitimate point in mitigation that there was some independent evidence to indicate that the complainant had not then appeared to find that the appellant's advances to her were distasteful or repugnant. Next, he points out that in the scale of these offences this case, which never involved the touching of bare flesh in any intimate part, let alone any contact of the same kind, was to be regarded as at the lower end of significance and therefore a case which would attract the lower end of sentence. Finally, Mr Blades submitted that the sentence for this offence should have been put in the context of the sentence imposed on the appellant following his conviction at the first court martial, and that the totality of sentence included not only the overall length of the period which he would have to serve in custody, but also the significant overall financial damage consequent upon the orders made by the two court martials.
24.
We have no doubt that a prison sentence was appropriate for these two offences. The Board would rightly have been concerned for military discipline, morale and recruitment, particularly in the context of efforts to attract young women into the Service. It was necessary to make clear to them, and indeed throughout the Service that, so far as possible, women, and young women in particular, would be protected from unwelcome sexual attention and that those convicted of such offences should expect significant punishment.
25.
Reflecting on these considerations and looking at the sentence overall, which Mr Blades rightly invited us to do, we have concluded that we should not interfere with the sentences imposed on the appellant for indecent assault but that, as a matter of totality, we should order that the sentences will run from the date of conviction. To that extent, therefore, this appeal will be allowed.

LORD JUSTICE COULSON:
1.
The applicant is now aged 33.  On 21
st
February 2022, in the Crown Court at Newcastle Upon Tyne, he changed his plea to guilty to one offence of kidnapping (count 1) and one offence of robbery (count 2). On 18
th
July 2022, he was sentenced by Her Honour Judge Clemitson (“the judge”) to 10 years' imprisonment.
2.
The applicant now renews his applications for an extension of time (257 days) in which to apply for leave to appeal against that sentence, following refusal by the single judge.
3.
The applicant had been involved in some sort of business deal with a man named Abdul Jabar, which went wrong.  Jabar had a shop and a flat in Gateshead and employed two men, including Hardi Ahmadi, who lived in his flat and worked in his shop.  The takings from the shop were kept in a drawer in the flat, although only the two men and Mr Jabar knew of its precise whereabouts.
4.
The applicant and a man called Saeed drove in a van through the night from Ipswich to Newcastle.  A co-accused, Salih, was a passenger in the van.  Another car was driven in convoy with the van.  That car was owned by the applicant and occupied by three men, including two co-accused, Staskauskis and Straksys.  At some point a decision was made by the applicant to kidnap one of the young men who worked in Jabar’s shop.  The applicant and Saeed went to Tesco in Kingston Park, from where they bought duct tape and latex gloves.  The two vehicles were driven to Gateshead and Hardi Ahmadi was intercepted on his way to work.
5.
He was bundled into the back of the van.  His head was covered with a blanket and his hands and legs tied at the back with duct tape.  Duct tape was also used to cover his eyes.  The men demanded that he tell them where the money was.  He was badly beaten and the men threatened to stab him in the heart.  Ahmadi thought he was going to die and recited a Muslim prayer apposite for the moment before dying.
6.
Ahmadi subsequently told the men where the takings were.  They had taken the key to the flat and some of them, including the applicant, went to the flat and removed between £6,000 and £7,000 from the drawer.
7.
During this time Ahmadi remained bound in the back of the van.  He was told that if he made a noise, he would be killed.  He was struggling to breathe.  He said that he saw his life flash before his eyes and he thought that he was going to die.  Whilst away from the van, the applicant received a call from his co-accused Staskauskis telling him that Ahmadi was praying for his life and ""did not look good"". Once the money had been taken, Ahmadi was dumped behind a pile of sand in a car park in County Durham.  He was bleeding and was still bound, with tape still over his eyes.  Ahmadi was found by members of a walking group who happened to be passing nearby. The police were called, and they identified the van from CCTV footage.
8.
The van was stopped by police officers in Yorkshire on its way back to Ipswich.  The applicant, Straksys and Staskauskis were in the van and immediately arrested.  The best part of £9,000 was recovered from a backpack inside the van, along with the blanket, the duct tape and the gloves. The car in which Saeed, Salih and another man were travelling was not intercepted.  Of those three, only Salih was later found by the police and arrested.
9.
When the judge came to sentence the applicant and the co-accused, she said that she was quite sure that Saeed and the applicant were the prime movers in the venture.  She said that she was sure that the applicant had travelled to the northeast “in order to relieve Abdul Jabar of a significant amount of money or other property such as cigarettes”.
10.
As to the particular factors relevant to the applicant, the judge said this:
""Abdul Rostami, you are 31.  You have five convictions for eleven offences.  They include several offences of assault for which you have previously been sent to prison and more recently you were made the subject of a suspended sentence of imprisonment for a drugs offence and evasion of duty.  You sustained a significant head injury and possibly, as a consequence of that, you suffer some symptoms which are being addressed by cognitive behavioural therapy.  Otherwise, you have no diagnosed mental illness or disorder.  You do have some very real and significant physical health difficulties which resulted in surgery in October 2020.  It is of note that that surgery took place before you committed these offences.""
11.
There are no sentencing guidelines in respect of kidnapping.  The judge said that the appropriate way to arrive at a proper sentence in this case was to consider these offences together as a robbery, aggravated by the offence of kidnapping.  The judge said that for the purposes of the robbery guidelines, this was akin to a professionally planned, commercial robbery, albeit that the lack of sophistication had to be marked by an appropriate downwards adjustment within that guideline.  She found that the harm fell withing category 2; and in the case of the applicant, his leading role meant that his culpability was in category A. A category 2A offence has a starting point of nine years' custody and a recommended range of 7 to 14 years imprisonment.  The judge identified the various factors to which we have already referred, and also other aggravating features, namely: the steps taken to prevent the victim from reporting the offence or obtaining assistance; the prolonged nature of the attack; the restraint and detention of the victim for a lengthy period of time; and the ongoing impact on the victim.
12.
Taking all those matters into account, the judge identified a starting point of 11 years' imprisonment.  In so doing, she had regard to the aggravating factors and the applicant's leading role, but also to his significant personal mitigation.  She reduced the starting point of 11 years by ten per cent, being the credit for his late guilty plea, thus arriving at the term of ten years' imprisonment.
13.
The single judge refused leave to appeal on the basis that there was nothing in any of the criticisms belatedly raised by the applicant.  He also refused the extension of time.  He said:
""The reality is that you were correctly advised that your appeal has no merit.  This did not justify what was then a very substantial delay in bringing your appeal.""
14.
In our view, the single judge was plainly right to refuse an extension of time.  There was no explanation at all for the delay in making this application.
15.
Furthermore, we consider that the single judge was also right to conclude that there was nothing in any of the grounds of appeal in any event.  Working our way through the undated, handwritten grounds of appeal received by the Criminal Appeal Office on 16
th
August 2023, our brief conclusions are as follows.
16.
First, it is said that the applicant was given the maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment because the CPS changed their minds and said that, rather than playing a lesser role, the applicant had played a leading role.
17.
This complaint is misconceived.  Although the applicant had put in a basis of plea that sought to minimise his role, that was not accepted by the Crown.  On the basis of the material before her, the judge concluded that the applicant had played a leading role.  On the material that we have seen, that was the correct categorisation.
18.
Secondly, it is said that the applicant was not given credit for his guilty plea.  But he plainly was.  He pleaded guilty only on the day of trial, so was not entitled to more than ten per cent credit.  The judge was careful to give him that credit, otherwise, as she said, ""You would have been sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment"".
19.
Thirdly, the applicant complains that the other defendants received lesser sentences, and the applicant suggests that this was ""blatantly wrong"".  Again, we consider that the complaint is misconceived.  The co-defendants received lesser sentences because their roles were less significant and therefore their culpability was lower.  Of the defendants before the court, it was only the applicant who played a leading role.  It was therefore inevitable that he would receive a longer term of imprisonment.
20.
Furthermore, the applicant had a worse record than any of his co-defendants, including convictions for offences of violence.  The judge was correct to say that this demonstrated ""a vicious side to your nature and a propensity to use gratuitous violence"".  In addition, the author of the pre-sentence report identified the applicant as posing a significant risk of causing serious harm, despite the fact that the author was unaware of the previous offending.  There were, therefore, a number of aggravating factors in the applicant's case which simply did not apply to the other defendants.
21.
Furthermore, we consider that the judge would have been entitled to consider the applicant to be a dangerous offender and to impose an extended sentence.  She said that expressly at page 6E of her sentencing remarks.  However, she decided, because of his age and his state of health, together with the time that he would spend in custody, that she would not impose such an order.
In our view, that was a merciful conclusion and one that other judges may not have reached.  The applicant can therefore count himself fortunate that he was not given a longer sentence.
22.
For those reasons, therefore, we consider that there is nothing whatever in this renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence. Both the renewed application for leave to appeal and the renewed application for an extension of time are therefore refused.

    Exact: The co-defendants received lesser sentences because their roles were less significant and therefore their culpability was lower.  Of the defendants before the court, it was only the applicant who played a leading role.  It was therefore inevitable that he would receive a longer term of imprisonment.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:
Background
1.
This reference raises yet again the vexed question of the appropriate level of sentence for sexual offences on children committed many years ago by an offender who was himself a child at the time.
2.
On 22nd January 2016, after a contested trial, the offender was convicted of two counts of indecent assault on a male person, one of whom we shall call ""X"" and the other we shall call ""Y"". The offence on X was committed between April 1979 and April 1981 and the offence on Y between March 1982 and January 1987. Both offences were contrary to section 15(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. The parties at trial agreed, and informed the trial judge, that in the light of the likely dates of the commission of the offences, the offences attracted a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment. The parties now agree the maximum penalty for both offences was ten years' imprisonment.
3.
On 5th February 2016 His Honour Judge Rennie, the trial judge, having received notes on sentencing from the advocates, a number of testimonials for the offender and personal impact statements from the complainants, sentenced the offender to a term of imprisonment of two years on each count suspended for two years. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Her Majesty's Solicitor General, represented by Mr Jarvis, has sought the leave of the court to refer the sentences to us on the basis they are unduly lenient.
4.
The facts are, in summary, that the offender and his parents lived close to X and his family in Sussex. The families were good friends and X was also friends with a boy called Y; they sometimes played together in a nearby Wendy House. X claimed that the offender, who was a number of years older than X, sexually assaulted him twice. However, the offender was only convicted of the one offence, and it is to that offence we now turn.
5.
In 1979/1980 X said he was visiting the offender's home and he asked to go upstairs with the offender to see his pet gerbils. X sat on the corner of the bed with the offender standing in front of him. The offender took down his pants and his trousers, exposing his penis. The offender said, ""It's all right to touch it if you like"". At this, X grabbed the offender's penis. The offender then said, ""It's all right to kiss it"", so X did. The offender then put his penis into X's mouth and held his head. X said he was frightened and tried to struggle. He felt something go into his mouth and thought that the offender had urinated. The offender pulled down X's shorts and pants so his genitals were exposed.
6.
Fortunately, X's mother was outside. She shouted for him to come home. The offender held X up to the window in a way that X's mother could not see he was naked from the waist down and told X, ""Tell her you'll be back in a few minutes or I'll drop you"". X told his mother to go home and he would be back soon. He was too frightened to say anything else. The judge sentenced on the basis that the evidence indicated the victim was three and the offender eleven at the time of this offence.
7.
Y described an occasion when he felt pressure from the offender and X to go into the Wendy House with the offender. X said, ""I've been in the Wendy House. Why don't you go in? It's cool"". Y went in but X stayed outside. Once inside, Y's trousers were taken down and the offender played with Y's penis before placing it into his, the offender's, mouth. According to Y, it felt ‘weird’. Afterwards he did not tell anyone what had happened because he was too ashamed. He never went into the Wendy House again. The judge sentenced on the basis that the evidence revealed that the offender was fourteen at the time of the offence and Y was five.
8.
X and Y remained friends but drifted apart as teenagers. Some years later X told his mother what had happened to him namely that the offender had had oral sex and threatened to throw him out of a window. He also told her that ""things had gone on"" in the Wendy House.
9.
In 2006, Y became involved with the Landmark Forum, which helps people cope with trauma from their past. He decided to meet with X so they could talk about their experiences as children. Their accounts differ of what was said at that meeting, but there was no report to the police.
10.
In 2007, X saw the offender speaking to a group of teenage boys. This made his angry and he decided to report what had happened. He made a witness statement to the police. For reasons that are not clear, that did not lead to the offender's arrest or prosecution.
11.
It was not until 2013 that Y decided to report the offender to the police. The offender was interviewed and he denied any sexual abuse, and he continues to do so.
12.
At the time of sentencing, the offender had no criminal convictions on his record; he had just one caution for an offence of common assault committed in 2004.
13.
In his victim personal statement of January 2016, X wrote that as a result of the offence he started to self-harm from the age of thirteen and he suffered flashbacks to what the offender had done. This caused him to experience sleeplessness, a lack of concentration and his studies suffered. He became suicidal and had to be treated in hospital and in the community for mental health problems. He continues to receive counselling. He also said that he was unable to maintain relationships. X feels that the offender's actions have ""ruined"" him.
14.
In his victim personal statement, dated 28th January 2016, Y states that the offence did not impact on his life as he grew up, it was only after he received counselling that he decided he wanted to press charges against the offender. Looking back, he believes that the offence may have made him distrustful of people, but otherwise makes no comment as to any long-term consequences.
Discussion
15.
Mr Jarvis submitted there were a number of aggravating factors to the offences:
1.
the grooming of X on a previous occasion
2.
ejaculation in respect of the offence on X;
3.
the location of the offence in respect of the offence on Y;
4.
the presence of another child, in respect of the offence on Y;
5.
steps taken to prevent X reporting an incident;
6.
the use of X to recruit Y.
16.
During the course of submissions this morning, we pressed Mr Jarvis on whether all these factors were a. proved and b. could all be described as aggravating features. No finding of fact was recorded in respect of the grooming incident, there was no evidence X was present when Y was assaulted and X did not accept he was used to recruit Y. Further, we failed to see the significance of the location of the offences as an aggravating feature.
17.
The following mitigating factors appeared to HM Solicitor General to be present: the offender has no relevant previous convictions, the age and lack of maturity of the offender at the time of the commission of the offences, and the age of the allegations.
18.
Balancing all those factors, Mr Jarvis criticised the overall length of the sentence and the judge's decision to suspend it. It was his contention that the sentences should have been ordered to run consecutively, and not concurrently, to reflect the fact that they were committed against different victims and at different times, some years apart. Alternatively, if the sentences were properly ordered to run concurrently, he submitted the sentence for the offence on X should have been longer given its nature and seriousness and because it was aggravated by the offence on Y.
19.
Finally, if those arguments failed, Mr Jarvis’ fall back submission was that the sentence should not have been suspended. The judge explained his rationale for suspension in this way:
""... I'm also persuaded that because of the passage of time, your age at the time, your good character and all that I have heard, the just sentence to pass is a suspended sentence.""
No-one reminded the judge, as Mr Jarvis reminded us, that where offences were committed before 4th April 2005, the power to suspend a term of imprisonment was governed by the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and not the Criminal Justice Act 2003, as the judge may have believed. Section 118(4) of the PCC(S)A 2000 states that a sentence of imprisonment can only be suspended where there are exceptional circumstances to justify such a course. Placing reliance on
Attorney General's Reference No 61 of 2014
[2015] Cr App R (S) 25, Mr Jarvis submitted that the passage of time is not
per se
an exceptional circumstance. Further, he maintained that the offender's age at the time the offences were committed and his good character were not sufficient, in isolation or cumulatively, to amount to exceptional circumstances so as to justify suspension of the sentence.
20.
Mr Jarvis took us to the various sentencing guidelines of potential relevance namely: the Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline of 2014, the Overarching Principles - Sentencing Youths Guideline and the Offences Taken Into Consideration and Totality Definitive Guidelines.
21.
Having regard to Annex B of the Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline, Mr Jarvis argues that the modern equivalent of the offence on X is rape of a child under the age of 13, contrary to section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. He invited the court to place the offence into category 2: X was particularly vulnerable due to his extreme youth and he has suffered severe psychological harm. Further, he suggested that this is culpability A because of the deliberate isolation of X from his mother and or because of the element of grooming. If that categorisation is correct, the starting point for an adult offender after a trial would be one of 13 years' imprisonment, with a range of 11 to 17 years (all beyond the actual maximum for this offence).
22.
However, Mr Jarvis fully and fairly acknowledged that one must bear very much in mind the overarching principles in sentencing youths. Many of those principles (such as considerations of the welfare of the child) will not be relevant because the court is sentencing an adult not a youth; but age and maturity at the time of the offence are relevant to the issue of culpability. At page 24 of the guideline the Sentencing Guidelines Council states:
""where the offender is aged 15, 16 or 17, the court will need to consider the maturity of the offender as well as chronological age. Where there is no offence specific guideline, it may be appropriate, depending on maturity, to consider a starting point from half to three quarters of that which would have been identified for an adult offender ...
where the offender is aged 14 or less ... the length of a custodial sentence will normally be shorter than for an offender aged 15–17 convicted of the same offence.""
23.
In relation to the offence committed against X, Mr Jarvis contended that an 18 year old committing such an offence today could expect the sentencing court to take a starting point of term of 13 years' detention and that this gives an indication of just how serious Parliament, and therefore the courts, view offending of this type. If one then factored in the mitigation available to the offender and applied a reduction of 75 per cent, he maintained the sentence should have been at least three years for offending of this gravity.
24.
As far as the offence against Y is concerned, the modern equivalent, is said to be sexual assault of a child under 13 contrary to section 7, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years. Mr Jarvis placed the level of harm into category 2 because the offender touched Y's naked genitalia and the level of culpability at A because he deliberately isolated him by coaxing him into the Wendy House. This would mean a starting point for an adult offender after trial of four years' imprisonment, with a range of three to seven years. Given the offender's age at the time of the offence, namely 14, there would be a further substantial discount to be afforded to him. On that basis Mr Jarvis accepted that a sentence of two years custody could not be described as unduly lenient in itself. It is the combination of the two offences and the overall level of offending that he claims have not be properly reflected in the sentence passed.
Conclusion
25.
All parties acknowledge that this was an extraordinarily difficult sentencing exercise for the judge. Sentencing for offences committed decades ago is never easy, let alone when the offender was a child at the time. It is therefore worth reminding oneself of the guidance provided by the court and Lord Judge CJ in
R v Hall and others
[2012] 1 WLR 1416
, [2012] 2 Cr App R (S) 21, in which the court conducted a comprehensive review of all the relevant sentencing principles governing historic offences. Lord Judge stated at paragraph 46:
""In the search for principle it is impossible to reconcile them all. We suggest that with the exception of
Millberry and Others
, and the definitive sentencing guideline (used in the measured way we shall suggest) that the following considerations should be treated as guidance. We further suggest that reference to earlier decisions is unlikely to be helpful, and, again dealing with it generally, to be discouraged. Subsequent decisions of this court which do not expressly state that they are intended to amend or amplify this guidance should also be treated as fact specific decisions, and therefore unlikely to be of assistance to [the] court.""
26.
We are unaware of any subsequent decisions in which the court has expressly stated that it intended to amend or amplify the guidance provided and accordingly,
H
remains the leading authority. The guidance is to be found at paragraph 47:
1.
“Sentence will be imposed at the date of the sentencing hearing, on the basis of the legislative provisions then current, and by measured reference to any definitive sentencing guidelines relevant to the situation revealed by the established facts.
2.
Although sentence must be limited to the maximum sentence at the date when the offence was committed, it is wholly unrealistic to attempt an assessment of sentence by seeking to identify in 2011 what the sentence for the individual offence was likely to have been if the offence had come to light at or shortly after the date when it was committed. Similarly, if maximum sentences have been reduced, as in some instances, for example theft, they have, the more severe attitude to the offence in earlier years, even if it could be established, should not apply.
3.
As always, the particular circumstances in which the offence was committed and its seriousness must be the main focus. Due allowance for the passage of time may be appropriate. The date may have a considerable bearing on the offender's culpability. If, for example, the offender was very young and immature at the time when the case was committed, that remains a continuing feature of the sentencing decision. Similarly if the allegations had come to light many years earlier, and when confronted with them, the defendant had admitted them, but for whatever reason, the complaint had not been drawn to the attention of, or investigated by, the police, or had been investigated and not then pursued to trial, these too would be relevant features.
27.
In some cases it may be safe to assume that the fact that, notwithstanding the passage of years, the victim has chosen spontaneously to report what happened to him or her in his or her childhood or younger years would be an indication of continuing inner turmoil. However the circumstances in which the facts come to light varies, and careful judgment of the harm done to the victim is always a critical feature of the sentencing decision. Simultaneously, equal care needs to be taken to assess the true extent of the defendant's criminality by reference to what he actually did and the circumstances in which he did it.
28.
The passing of the years may demonstrate aggravating features if, for example, the defendant has continued to commit sexual crime or he represents a continuing risk to the public. On the other hand, mitigation may be found in an unblemished life over the years since the offences were committed, particularly if accompanied by evidence of positive good character.
29.
Early admissions and a guilty plea are of particular importance in historic cases. Just because they relate to facts which are long passed, the defendant will inevitably be tempted to lie his way out of the allegations. It is greatly to his credit if he makes early admissions. Even more powerful mitigation is available to the offender who out of a sense of guilt and remorse reports himself to the authorities. Considerations like these provide the victim with vindication, often a feature of great importance to them.”
30.
We apply those principles to the present application, noting as we do the reference to using the current Definitive Guideline on Sexual Offences in a “measured” fashion and the prohibition on conducting the ""wholly unrealistic exercise"" of attempting to assess what the sentence would have been, had the offence come to light shortly after it was committed.
31.
Our focus must be on the seriousness of the offences, the harm caused and on the offender's culpability. We note that, not only was the judge misled as to the maximum sentence available, no one invited the judge to make findings as to whether the grooming incident occurred in respect of X, whether X was present at the assault of Y (the evidence suggests he was not) and whether X was used to recruit Y. Given their potential significance, it would be wrong to allow such factors to play a part in the categorisation of the offence or as an aggravating feature, absent a sound evidential basis. In any event, we have our doubts as to whether it is apt to describe what may have occurred between an eleven year boy and a three year old boy as ‘grooming’ and to describe the offender as having ‘deliberately isolated’ the victims. The evidence suggests an eleven year old boy and then a fourteen year old boy taking advantage of opportunities that presented themselves when playing with younger boys, rather than any act of grooming or deliberate isolation of the kind the Sentencing Council had in mind. As we have already observed, the location of the offences seems to us to be irrelevant. We accept the other aggravating factors were present, albeit in the context of offending by a young boy.
32.
On that basis, using the current guideline, the correct category for the offences on X and on Y would be 2 B and the categorisation itself takes account of most of the aggravating features. Had these offences been committed by an adult today, the guideline indicates the overall sentence would be lengthy.
33.
For the offence on X, category 2B has a starting point of ten years and a range of eight to thirteen years (beyond the maximum available for the offence committed). However, the offender was very young and immature at the time he assaulted the two complainants. Any sentence would therefore have to be reduced very significantly to reflect the much lower level of culpability of an eleven year old (arguably by more than 75%) and to reflect the substantial mitigation available. On that basis we do not accept that the figure of 2 years determined by the judge was outside the appropriate range.
34.
We turn to the length of the sentence for the offence on Y. Having placed the offence on Y in category 2B, the starting point for a section 7 offence is two years with a range of one to four years. There are no particular aggravating features present and much mitigation. Further there must be a substantial reduction to reflect the offender’s lower level of culpability as a fourteen year old. Had the judge ordered the sentences to be served consecutively, as would be the normal practice where there is more than one victim, he may well have reduced the sentence for the offence on Y still further to reflect the principle of totality.
35.
On that basis, one might well reach a total sentence for the offences on X and Y at, or a little above, the level of sentence that can in law be suspended.
36.
Finally, we address the question of suspension. Firstly, it is unfortunate that the judge was not informed of the relevant statutory provision. He should have been. Secondly and, in any event, we reject the argument that the judge would not have been entitled to suspend the sentence on the basis of exceptional circumstances. The court, in
Attorney General's Reference No 61 of 2014
, did not, in our view, intend to lay down any general principle that the passage of time can never amount to an exceptional circumstance. The judgment makes clear that the facts of that case were unusual. The offender had committed a further sexual offence as an adult, and the overall circumstances were not so exceptional as to justify suspension.
37.
If, as the judgment in
H
makes clear, the passage of time since an offence, the age of an offender at the time he committed an offence, and the fact an offender has not been convicted of any offence since the offending, are all factors to be considered when assessing sentence generally, we see no good reason why they may not be relevant to the question of suspension. It will be for the sentencing judge to make a judgment on all the facts before him or her. We have not rehearsed the detail of the mitigation available to the offender but it was considerable.
38.
There is no principle of sentencing that all offences of this kind must be met by immediate terms of imprisonment, whatever the circumstances. As the Definitive Guideline makes clear, as serious as these offences were, there may be exceptional cases where a non-custodial sentence is appropriate. It is clear to us from the transcript of the sentencing hearing that the judge was acutely conscious of the seriousness of the offences, the impact of the offences on the victims and the relevant guidelines. He did not take the decision to suspend the sentence lightly. He took a measured and balanced approach with which we do not intend to interfere.
39.
We should like to express our hope that the complainants, both of whom have had to struggle to come to terms with their abuse, will find some form of closure in the fact that these proceedings are now at an end and that their abuser has been brought to justice in public, albeit he may not have received the severe kind of punishment that some may have wished upon him.

1.
LORD JUSTICE ROSE: The Attorney General seeks the leave of the court under
section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988
to refer sentences on these three offenders to this court on the ground that they were unduly lenient. We grant leave.
2.
The offender, Stechman, is 16, having been born in January 1988. The offender, Griffin, is 17, having been born in October 1986, and the offender, Walton, is 16, having been born in March 1988.
3.
On 7 November 2003, Griffin pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to
section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861
. On 23 February 2004, the two other offenders, Walton and Stechman, pleaded guilty to the same offence. On 16 April 2004, they were sentenced at Inner London Crown Court by Mr Recorder Conlin. Stechman and Griffin were sentenced to a Community Punishment and Rehabilitation Order consisting of 100 hours' Community Punishment and 24 months' Rehabilitation, and both were also subjected to an electronically monitored curfew for six months from 8pm to 8am. In relation to Walton, a Community Rehabilitation Order for two years was made, together with a similar curfew order.
4.
In summary, the three offenders approached the 14 year-old male victim at about 11 o'clock on the evening of 22 August 2003. They took his bicycle, pushed it into his leg, kicked and punched him about the face and body, threatened to kill him, broke his arm and threw him into a nearby canal.
5.
In a little more detail, the victim was sitting on a curb in Dame Street, London N1 on this summer evening. His bicycle was propped behind him. The three offenders approached. The victim recognised the offender, Stechman. Walton took the bicycle and rode it away. Stechman and Griffin walked alongside Walton, laughing and joking. The victim followed, trying to retrieve his bicycle. Walton rammed the bicycle into the boy's right leg, causing him to fall back against a wall. All three offenders then began punching and kicking him about the head and body. The boy pleaded with them to stop. They continued, saying he had better not tell the police or he would get more.
6.
Stechman suggested they kill the victim by ""popping"" his head on the spikes of some railings nearby. The kicking and punching continued. The boy tried to protect his face with his arm, but Walton pulled his right arm away and said he was going to break it. Thereupon the boy's face became unprotected and Stechman and Griffin punched him repeatedly in the face. All three said they were going to kill him.
7.
They dragged him to the spiked railings and the earlier threat was repeated. Walton suggested that, instead, they should throw him into the canal. That was agreed. They dragged him, still beating him, to the canal. They took off his jacket. They swung him backwards and forwards twice, before throwing him into the canal. He surfaced about halfway across and was able to swim to the other side. As he did so, he heard the offenders say, ""Let's throw some rocks at him"". They did not in fact throw rocks.
8.
Later, at hospital, it was found that his left elbow was broken in three places. He had bruising around his left eye and right cheek, and abrasions to his forehead, the back of his head, his left arm and knees.
9.
On behalf of the Attorney General, Miss Whitehouse draws attention to the following aggravating features: first, the attack was unprovoked; secondly, it was carried out by three against one; thirdly, the victim was only 14; fourthly, he was kicked with shod feet as he lay on the floor; finally, he was thrown into a canal, with his arm by that stage broken whether the offenders knew it or not, so that he had to swim to survive.
10.
Miss Whitehouse draws attention to the mitigation to be found in the fact that Stechman and Walton were only 15 and Griffin only 16 at the time. Griffin pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and had no previous convictions of relevance. It is right to say that none of these offenders has any previous conviction for violence. Walton has a poor record for dishonesty.
11.
Miss Whitehouse drew attention to a number of authorities, including
Attorney General's Reference No 59 of 1996
[1997] 2 Cr App R (S) 250,
Attorney General's Reference Nos 30 and 31 of 1998
[1999] 1 Cr App R (S) 200 and
Attorney General's Reference No 121 of 2002
[2003] EWCA Crim 684
. In
Attorney General's Reference Nos 59, 60 and 63 of 1998
[1999] 2 Crim App R (S) 128 at 131, Lord Bingham CJ, giving the judgment of the court, said this:
""When an offender, however young, deliberately inflicts serious injury on another there is a legitimate public expectation that such offender will be severely punished to bring home to him the gravity of the offence and to warn others of the risk of behaving in the same way. If such punishment does not follow, public confidence in the administration of the criminal law is weakened and the temptation arises to give offenders extra-judicially the punishment that the formal processes of law have not given. When we speak of the public we do not forget the victim, the party who has actually suffered the injury, and those close to him. If punishment of the offender does little to heal the victim's wounds, there can be little doubt that inadequate punishment adds insult to injury.""
12.
The submission which is made by Miss Whitehouse in the light of those authorities and the circumstances of this case is that a community punishment wholly failed to reflect the gravity of the offence and a custodial penalty was required. In consequence, she submits, the sentences passed by the learned Recorder were unduly lenient.
13.
On behalf of Stechman, Miss Hayne concedes that the sentence was lenient and that the authorities show that custody is ordinarily appropriate. But, she submits, there are, in the present case, personal circumstances of mitigation so far as Stechman is concerned which justify a non-custodial penalty. She points out, as we have already said, that he is only 15 and he has no previous convictions. This offence was entirely out of character. He had been drinking heavily, not looking for violence. He accepts that what he did was appalling and despicable. But, she submits, he has shown genuine remorse and has made progress in the months which have passed since he was sentenced in April. He has not breached his order. He has, it is true, difficulty in talking about the offence, but he is only 16, even now.
14.
There are indications in one of the pre-sentence reports upon him that he is experiencing difficulty in expressing sympathy with the victim. Miss Hayne points out that the nature of the area where he lives is such that he is being taunted by some for his part in this attack and taunted by others for having pleaded guilty to the offence. Sadly, as Miss Hayne points out, his grandfather died soon after the offence was committed, but before Stechman was sentenced. She submits that he has taken such opportunity as was presented by the Recorder's sentence to show signs of improvement for the future, and she asserts he will not be before the courts again. He spent a week in custody before he was sentenced by the Recorder.
15.
Miss Hadfield, on behalf of Walton, accepts that the sentence was an unusually lenient one, but he spent some seven months in custody before he was sentenced, and during that period, had to endure the death of a baby born prematurely to his girlfriend of which he was the father.
16.
Miss Hadfield's second submission is that, even if the sentence was unduly lenient, the court should not exercise its discretion to interfere with it. She stresses the plea of guilty, the absence of premeditation and the lack of any sign of violence in the offender, Walton's, previous record. She said that it was not obvious why in Walton's case the Recorder had imposed a different sentence to that imposed on the other two offenders. But it may be that he had in mind the fact that Walton had already spent seven months in custody.
17.
Miss Hadfield drew attention to the contents of the reports upon Walton, indicating that he has taken responsibility for doing that which he did, and has written a letter of apology and expressed his remorse. He has an unhappy youthful background, having been in and out of care, in particular during the currency of previous supervision orders.
18.
He has apparently been in breach of the curfew order which the Recorder imposed, and that is due to be dealt with later this week. That came about because he left his mother's address and he is now apparently living in sheltered accommodation. It is apparent that the evidence which his mother gave before the Recorder, indicating an apparent increase in maturity following the death of his baby, had a significant influence upon the Recorder.
19.
Miss Hadfield submits that, in view of Walton's age, the balance in his case tips in favour of rehabilitation rather than punishment. He has responded to the order which was made and has engaged fully, apart from the breach of curfew to which we have referred.
20.
Miss Hadfield refers to double jeopardy, that is the second sentencing process, which is involved in all Attorney General's References, and she submits that the offender, Walton, is being rehabilitated by the sentence which the Recorder passed.
21.
On behalf of Griffin, Miss Bex stresses that he displayed courage in that he was the first to plead guilty: by reason of that, he is entitled to maximum credit. He has been on bail throughout and for a short period worked. Indeed his then employer gave evidence before the Recorder as to how well he was doing after some two weeks, and the Recorder was clearly impressed by that. The present position is that the offender is not living with his mother. He has been sleeping at her garden gate and breach proceedings in relation to the curfew are to be considered by the youth court next week. She accepts that he has, as is apparent from the reports, failed to comply with the punishment part of the order, and he has, according to the report, been verbally abusive to staff. She submits that his present position, as we have briefly described it, is cruel so far as he is concerned.
22.
There are clearly particular circumstances of mitigation affecting each of these three offenders in different ways: in relation to Stechman, the sad death of his grandfather; in relation to Walton, the sad death of his baby; in relation to Griffin, his early plea of guilty. Looking at the picture in the round, we are satisfied that no distinction should be drawn in the way in which the three offenders are dealt with.
23.
This was a terrible offence - in its persistence, in the variety of violence, in the numbers involved, and in its culmination in the victim being cast into the canal. The physical injuries were serious and included the multiple fractures of the elbow, to which we have referred. There were mental injuries as well. The victim has required psychological treatment. That being so, notwithstanding the pleas of guilty and the youth of all these three offenders, we would have expected a sentence in the court below in relation to each of them of three years' detention under the
Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, S.91
. That is not a sentence which this court should now impose, having regard both to double jeopardy and the fact that, if they are incarcerated now, having previously been at liberty since they were sentenced, a further discount is called for from the sentence which would be appropriate. Taking those matters into account, subject to one matter in relation to Walton, which we will deal with, the sentence which would here be appropriate in relation to all three offenders is a Detention and Training Order of two years.
24.
So far as Walton is concerned, because, as we have said, he has spent seven months in custody prior to sentence which period would not count towards his sentence, the sentence which we impose on him is a Detention and Training Order of 12 months. In relation to Stechman and Griffin, the sentence is a 24-month Detention and Training Order. Those sentences will start to run when the offenders respectively surrender to custody.
25.
Miss Hayne, Miss Hadfield, Miss Bex, so far as surrender is concerned, we know not whether or not they are here at court?
26.
They are present in court. Is there any reason why they should not surrender now?
27.
MISS BEX: My Lord, no.
28.
LORD JUSTICE ROSE: We shall direct that they surrender at 1 o'clock.","citation:

Judgment
The Hon. Mr. Justice Saunders:
1.
These Applicants are fish merchants. On 11
th
May 2007, at Newcastle Crown Court they pleaded guilty to 5 counts of failing to submit sales notes and landing declarations relating to purchases of fish that they made. They pleaded on a basis that they were not intending to deceive anyone but they were not aware of the requirements of the legislation because they were so busy. These are offences of strict liability so that would not provide a defence but might affect sentence. They were sentenced by HH Judge Wood on 21
st
February 2008 to fines of £400 on each count and confiscation orders were made in the sum of £188,195 against Ian Perkes and in the sum of £150,000 against Sean Perkes. The Judge made it clear that he had moderated the level of the fines because of the size of the Confiscation Orders.
2.
The Applicants seek leave to appeal against the Confiscation Orders, their applications for leave having been referred to the full Court by the single Judge.
3.
The offences were contrary to the Sea Fishing (Enforcement of Community Control Measures) Order which is designed to prevent over fishing of fish stocks in relation to certain species. These Defendants were only two of a number of people before the Court facing similar charges and the overall picture before the Court revealed widespread disregard of the provisions which, as the Judge said, not only threatened fish stocks but also was unfair on those who did obey the Regulations and whose livelihoods were thereby threatened. The Regulations required the first purchasers of fish to produce sales invoices to the Authorities to enable them to maintain the quota so that fish stocks can be preserved. The requirement is not limited to protected species but there was an exemption in relation to the purchase of fish from boats of less than 10 metres in length.
4.
The Confiscation Proceedings against the 2 Applicants were originally contested. Indeed all the evidence on which the parties wished to rely was called before the Judge over 2 days. The Prosecution were claiming just over £950,000 in the Confiscation Proceedings, covering purchases made over a 6 year period prior to the offences. Although it was not conceded at the hearing by the Applicants, this case came within the criminal lifestyle provisions as the Judge would have been bound to conclude. The Court would then have had to apply the statutory presumptions. The main thrust of the Applicants’ argument before the Judge was that it would be unfair to make the order asked by the Prosecution because not only were they ignorant of the requirements made by these Regulations but also the relevant Ministry had completely failed to inform the trade of their existence. However they did give evidence of their knowledge of the people from whom they purchased fish and whether the fish was caught using boats which were under 10 metres in length and whether they were first purchasers. As they effectively conceded on oath they had very little knowledge as to where the fish had come from. The hearing did not go well for the Applicants although they both had the opportunity to give evidence and did so. On the morning when the Judge was due to rule on the amount of the benefit, a discussion took place between the Judge and Counsel. The Judge was concerned that if he was driven to order the full amount claimed by the Prosecution, it would effectively destroy their business. He therefore encouraged a negotiation to agree a lesser figure. As a result a total figure of just over one third of the claim was agreed.
5.
As is conceded by the Applicants, it is not easy to appeal an agreed Order. They argue, however, that they had no option but to do the best deal they could because, as a result of inadequate advice they had been given by their legal team, they were not aware of the difficulties they faced, and, in particular, the evidential burden that fell on them arising from the assumptions which had to be made, as this was unquestionably a criminal lifestyle case. Therefore, not having had appropriate advice, the Applicants argue that through no fault of their own they were unprepared for the hearing and because the Judge was likely to calculate the benefit at just under £1m, they had no alternative but do the best deal that they could.
6.
We have been shown numerous attendance notes which give some indication of the advice being given to the Applicants by their Solicitor and Counsel. While not making any finding on the matter, and this is only an application for leave, we are prepared to accept that there is an arguable case that the Applicants were not being made fully aware of the difficulties that they faced especially in relation to the assumptions, and that as a consequence they did not prepare for the case as fully as they should. It is fair however to point out that as from the service of the s. 16 statement in July 2007 the Applicants were well aware of the amount claimed by the Prosecution and the basis for it. It is also clear that the Applicants knew or ought to have known that key issues at the hearing would be whether they were first purchasers of the fish and, if they were, whether the fish came from boats of under 10 metres in length.
7.
In deciding what test we should apply in determining whether to give leave, we have considered the case of Hirani [2008] EWCA 1463. This was another case where a Defendant was seeking to set aside a Confiscation Order made by consent in reliance on, it was said, incorrect legal advice. The facts are not identical but we have applied the guidance set out at paragraph 35 of the judgment namely that, where an agreed Confiscation Order is said to have been made on incorrect legal advice, the Order should only be set aside ‘in the most exceptional circumstances’ and ‘there would need to be a well founded submission that the whole process was unfair’.
8.
We have had to consider what the realities of this case were. The Prosecution case for confiscation was based on invoices recording cash purchases of fish. These did not contain the name of the purchaser in any identifiable form. In some cases they bore the name of a boat which, on enquiry being made by the Prosecution, proved to be fictitious or came from firms which the Prosecution were unable to trace. It is agreed by the Applicants that they came within the criminal lifestyle provisions. It is further agreed that, by virtue of the assumptions, it was for the Applicants to establish their case that the purchases represented by the invoices were legitimate in the sense that they came from boats under 10 metres in length or were not first purchases of the fish. Alternatively the Applicants could seek to demonstrate that the purchases were of non quota fish; in which case there was an argument that it would be unfair to make a Confiscation Order in relation to those purchases.
9.
Realistically the only way the presumption could be rebutted would be for the Applicants to identify the sellers of the fish and either call them to support the Applicants’ case or at least allow an investigation to be made to see whether those contentions were agreed. When interviewed in relation to the identities of the people who sold them the fish Sean Perkes was evasive and Ian Perkes walked out of the interview. Of course, both were entitled to remain silent but it does not suggest that they would have been prepared to name the sellers to the Judge and indeed neither Applicant did in his evidence. In the evidence they gave before the Judge both indicated that they were not in a position to identify the sellers. Further, on this application, the evidence filed by the Applicants that they wished to call on an appeal, did not include any identification of the sellers or anything like sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. It is well established that vague generalisations will not be sufficient to displace the assumptions set out in the Act.
10.
At the conclusion of the oral hearing we invited the Applicants, if they wished, to put in any evidence that they would be able to call to support their contention that, if properly advised, they would have been able to rebut these presumptions. What has been produced is an affidavit from Sean Perkes and a schedule identifying invoice by invoice the identity of the seller where it is known and also whether it comes from a boat of under 10 metres in length or was not a first time purchase. Looked at in the context of the case as a whole, we have concluded that that evidence, if it had been given, would not have been anything like sufficient to displace the assumptions that the Judge was required to make. Some of the evidence had been given at the hearing, although it is fair to say that more detail has been given in the schedule. One of the difficulties for the Applicants is that, where more detail is given, it is, at least on some occasions, contrary to what was said by one or other of the Applicants either in evidence on oath or in the course of interviews. Having considered that new evidence, we are quite satisfied that the Applicants were aware at the time of the confiscation that the issues it deals with were important to their case and could have been dealt with by them at the hearing before the Judge had they been prepared to give the detail they have included in the schedule. There is no supporting evidence from any of the suggested sellers and in most cases it is impossible to identify who they are.
11.
In those circumstances we do not think there is anything like an arguable case that the whole process was unfair. It is apparent from the affidavit that the Applicants believe that they have been very unfairly dealt with. However their real complaint would appear to be with the rigour of the legislation and the way it was enforced by the Ministry. We do not think that the court process was unfair; indeed it could well be argued that they were extremely lucky that the Judge took the humane course that he did which led to the settlement.
12.
The Applicants also complain that much of the confiscation hearing was conducted by the Prosecution on a basis that was contrary to the basis of plea. Having considered the cases of Lazurus
[2004] EWCA Crim 2297
and Lunnon
[2005] 1 Cr. App. R.(S) 24
, we are by no means satisfied that this is one of those cases where the Prosecution, by not contradicting a basis of plea, had bound itself in the Confiscation Proceedings. Further we are quite satisfied that, even if the Prosecution were so bound, that it did not render the proceedings unfair.","citation:

J U D G M E N T (Approved)
1.
MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE: This matter comes before the court on a renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction following a refusal by the single judge.
2.
We are grateful to Mr Farrell QC, who was instructed in the case after the single judge had given his decision, for his written submissions and his oral submissions to the court this morning.
3.
The grounds of appeal focus on the decision of the trial judge to admit in evidence two matters. First, the discovery in a warehouse in Swansea of items associated with the processing or trafficking of controlled drugs, on which were found the fingerprints of this Applicant. Secondly, evidence of the conviction of the Applicant many years ago for an offence of being concerned in the importation of cannabis. The cannabis imported on that occasion came from South Africa by air, as did the cannabis which was the subject of this trial. The quantity of the earlier matter was, however, very much less than the quantity involved in the present case.
4.
Mr Farrell submits that the basis on which the first of those two categories of evidence might be admitted was wrongly identified at trial. Whether it was because of the way the matter was placed before the judge, Mr Farrell does not profess to know, but he submits that in the event, there was no proper focus, as there should have been, on the relevant provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
, in particular
sections 101(1)
(d) and 101(3).
5.
We note that the prosecution's written notice of application to adduce bad character evidence appears to have been focused on the second category of evidence and mentioned the first only tangentially. We note also that the learned judge seems to have been considering the admissibility of the first category evidence more in the context of a defence application to exclude than in the context of a prosecution application to admit.
6.
Mr Farrell goes on to submit that absent the two categories of contentious evidence, the remaining prosecution evidence against this Applicant was very weak. Thus, he submits, particular care was required on the part of the learned judge to identify the precise basis on which evidence of bad character might be admissible so as to be able to make a proper assessment of whether its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.
7.
We are persuaded that these grounds are arguable and we therefore allow the application and grant leave to appeal.
8.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Thank you very much.
9.
MR FARRELL: Thank you very much, my Lords.
10.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: I think we probably need to direct a transcript of the argument leading up to the ruling on 26 January 2016.
11.
MR FARRELL: Could I just check?
(Pause)
12.
I do not think we do have that. Certainly if we do not have it, we certainly need it.
13.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: We do need it. How long will it take to get that, six weeks?
14.
MR FARRELL: Six weeks. Yes, I am sure.
15.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Then you need an extension of time. I think it is implicit that we grant that.
16.
MR FARRELL: Thank you very much indeed.
17.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: We will direct there should be a Respondent's skeleton. We have a respondent's notice, but I think there should be a Respondent's skeleton dealing with the particular points that you have raised and addressed by my Lord's judgment.
18.
MR FARRELL: Yes. I will make sure that I send a copy of my skeleton argument to prosecuting counsel, so I will e-mail it to him.
(Pause)
19.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: If you could send your skeleton in the next week, then we will allow a further three weeks for the prosecution respondent's notice.
20.
MR FARRELL: Sorry. So I am to send my current skeleton to the prosecution?
21.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Yes.
22.
MR FARRELL: Well, I will do that today --
23.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Yes, so be it.
24.
MR FARRELL: -- when I get back to chambers. Thank you very much indeed.
25.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Very good. Anything else?
26.
MR FARRELL: No thank you.
27.
LORD JUSTICE SIMON: Thank you for your submissions.
28.
MR FARRELL: Thank you very much, my Lords.","citation:

1.
MRS JUSTICE SHARP: This application for permission to appeal against sentence comes before the full court on the direction of the Registrar. It raises one point only, namely whether the judge was wrong to refuse to take into account the time that the applicant had spent on remand in custody when activating a suspended sentence.
2.
The applicant was sentenced by Mr Recorder Atherton on 30th September 2010, at Bolton Crown Court, for one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one offence of burglary. The assault occurred when two of the applicant's companions forced entry into the home of the complainant. The applicant then punched the complainant once, as result of what he was alleged to have said about the applicant's girlfriend.
3.
The burglary took place at the home of the applicant's mother. The applicant broke into her home and stole her mobile phone and £20 in cash when she was away on holiday.
4.
The applicant admitted the offence when interviewed. He was then 19 years old and had a poor record.
5.
When he came to be sentenced the applicant had by then been in custody on remand for 106 days. The Recorder imposed concurrent sentences of detention in a young offender institution for the two offences: 4 months for the assault and 2 months for the burglary which he suspended for 12 months with a Supervision Requirement.
6.
The applicant did not comply with the Supervision Requirement. He was brought back to court on 2nd December 2010 for breach of the Requirement and appeared before His Honour Judge Everett. The judge said that if the applicant now complied with future requirements of the probation service, he would give him another chance by imposing a breach activity requirement but that if he did not, he would be sent to prison.
7.
Still the applicant failed to comply. Accordingly, on 6th January 2011 the appellant appeared for a second time before His Honour Judge Everett for breach of the suspended sentence requirement.
8.
Miss Mushtaq, who appeared for the applicant on that occasion and appears for him today, submitted to the judge that he should give the applicant credit for the time spent on remand in custody, having regard to the provisions of
section 240(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
.
9.
The judge did not have the benefit of a transcript of the sentencing remarks made by Recorder Atherton on 30th September 2010. Nonetheless it appears from what the judge then said that he had some information as to what had been said by Recorder Atherton. We do not know what was available to the judge, but it is clear that the judge was under the impression as a result, first, that the Recorder had explicitly said he had taken the time the applicant had spent in custody into account when he passed sentence, and second, that the Recorder would otherwise have passed a sentence on the applicant ""in the region of 10 months"". In the result, the judge activated the suspended sentence in full. His view was, as he said expressly, that the applicant ""richly deserved the full 4 months"" that were imposed by the Recorder.
10.
In his sentencing remarks the judge said:
""The suspended sentence was imposed by Mr Recorder Atherton and Mr Recorder Atherton, in passing sentence, said (the comments that I have are), 'In sentencing you, I do take account of the time you have spent in custody.""
11.
We now have, as the judge did not, a transcript of Recorder Atherton's sentencing remarks. What the Recorder said was this:
""I have to bear in mind the public interest and the interest of trying to avoid further offending. It seemed to me that, if I were to send you back to Forest Bank, you would soon be released because of the time that you have spent in custody already and you would then be released into a situation of homelessness and hopelessness and a return to the company of people with whom you have been offending in the past, so that outlook is bleak.
The question is whether I can step back from an immediate custodial sentence and, having regard to your age and the fact that you indicated that you would plead guilty to this offence at the plea and case management hearing and that you admitted the offence at your mother's house, it seems to me that there is an alternative available to me, which is to impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment and that is what I will do. The offence itself merits six months imprisonment (that is in a young offender institution), having regard to the guilty plea that was indicated, that would probably be more appropriately a four month sentence, so that is what I am going to pass; a sentence of four months imprisonment, which will be suspended for 12 months on condition that you do not commit any further offence during that period.""
12.
In those circumstances Miss Mushtaq's principal submission is that the judge was wrong not to take the days spent on remand into account when activating the applicant's suspended sentence because he was wrong in his conclusion that those days had specifically been taken into account by the Recorder when he imposed the suspended sentence.
13.
In our judgment, it is indeed clear from the Recorder's sentencing remarks, as is submitted, that he did not expressly take the days the applicant had spent on remand in custody into account, although the length of the sentence that was passed might have suggested otherwise. On that ground alone it follows, in our view, that the judge's refusal to take the relevant days into account when activating the applicant's suspended sentence was wrong, for the reasons explained by this court in
R v Mari
[2010] EWCA Crim 1143
, a case in which a similar problem to the one which has arisen in this case occurred. See in particular paragraph 6 to 9 of that decision where Maddison J, giving the judgment of the court said this:
""The Registrar referred this case to the full court so that it could consider the lawfulness of the judge's approach. This case illustrates the sorts of problems that can arise when the activities of a persistent offender bring into play the somewhat complex provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
. We are sure that the judge's approach was in fact unlawful.
Sections 240(1)
,(3) and (4) insofar as they are material provide that when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence in connection with which the offender has been remanded in custody, it must direct that the number of days for which the offender has been thus remanded are to count as time served by him as part of the sentence unless it considers that it would not be just to give such a direction.
Section 240(7)
provides in effect that for the purposes of
section 240
a suspended sentence is to be treated as a sentence of imprisonment not when it is first imposed but if and when it is ordered to take effect, pursuant to paragraph 8 of schedule 12 to the Act of 2003, which governs the court's powers to activate a suspended sentence in whole or in part should the offender have broken any of the community requirements associated with the suspended sentence, or should he have committed a further offence during its operational period. Thus, in this case the judge was obliged to direct that the periods of 35 and 30 days, to which we have referred, should count towards the sentence unless he thought that it would be unjust to do so.
With respect to the judge, his assumption that the two judges who passed the suspended sentences would have adopted the approach to which he referred could not possibly found a legitimate conclusion that it would not be just to direct that the periods of 35 and 30 days should count towards the sentences he activated. In fact, there is nothing to suggest that either of the judges who passed the suspended sentences originally did in fact adopt the approach that His Honour Judge Hopkins QC assumed that they did.
If further support beyond the terms of the Act itself were required that the judge's approach was unlawful, it is to be found in the case of Fairbrother to which we have already referred, and in which this court in a constitution presided over by the then Vice Precedent, Latham LJ accepted without question that the sentencing judge had been in error in failing when activating a suspended sentence to direct that the 158 days that the appellant had spent in custody prior to the passing of that suspended sentence should count towards the effective sentence now being imposed, and proceeded to correct the error.""
14.
15.
Accordingly, we grant permission to appeal and allow the appeal against sentence to this extent only: we exercise our discretion under
section 240 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
, to credit the applicant with the time he has spent on remand in custody. We direct that the 106 days which, on the information presently before us, is the time that the applicant spent on remand in custody, shall count as time served by him as part of the sentence. In the event that the information we have been given is not accurate, then the number of days can be corrected administratively by communication with the Registrar to the Court of Appeal.","citation:

Judgment
Lord Justice Maurice Kay :
1.
On 10 May 2004 in the Crown Court at Maidstone the appellants were convicted of an offence of conspiracy to supply a class A drug, namely cocaine. They each later received sentences of 9 years imprisonment. There were two co-accused. A man called Turner pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply for which he received a sentence of six years imprisonment. Yolanda Tabares was found not guilty of the conspiracy by direction of the judge at the conclusion of the case for the prosecution.
2.
The factual background to the case fell within a narrow campus. Dunn and Turner lived at separate addresses in Dartford not far away from the Dartford Hilton hotel. On 29 October 2003 police officers observed Dunn driving a Land Rover Discovery with Turner in the front passenger seat. At 1847 Dunn drove the Land Rover into the car park of the Hilton Hotel. Gonzalez walked from a parked Ford Mondeo and gave a carrier bag to Turner through the passenger window of the Land Rover. Gonzalez then returned to the Mondeo in which Yolanda Tabares was seated. The officers stopped both vehicles as they attempted to leave the car park and the occupants were arrested. A plastic bag fell out of the passenger side of the Land Rover. A cardboard box in the front foot well contained about 2 kilogrammes of cocaine. When interviewed, Gonzalez denied knowledge of the cocaine. That apart, all four suspects declined to answer questions. Both Dunn and Gonzalez gave evidence. Both denied knowledge of the cocaine. Dunn said that Turner had asked him to drive him to the hotel but he did not know what Turner was going to do there or that he was involved with cocaine. Gonzalez said that he was paid by a man called Harold to deliver money in a bag to Turner at the hotel.
3.
It can be seen from that brief summary that the structure of the trial closely resembled many trials concerning the supply of drugs, with the primary defence of each defendant being that he did not know that the transaction with which the undisputed evidence connected him involved drugs. However, what began as an uncomplicated case took a different turn when Dunn was being cross-examined by the prosecution. In his evidence in chief and when cross-examined on behalf of Gonzalez he had not incriminated Gonzalez. However, prior to the trial and for good reason Dunn’s legal advisers had made it known to the prosecution that, according to Dunn, Gonzalez had admitted to Dunn whilst they were both remanded in custody that he knew at the time that he was concerned in the supply of cocaine. Accordingly, counsel for the prosecution asked Dunn about this in cross-examination and thereby elicited evidence of an alleged confession by Gonzales. It is common ground that that evidence exposed Dunn to cross-examination on behalf of Gonzalez pursuant to
section 1(3)(iii)
of the
Criminal Evidence Act 1898
. The judge permitted counsel for Gonzalez to cross-examine Dunn about his previous convictions (about which no complaint is made) and also about matters with which he had been charged and was awaiting trial, namely the possession of firearms found in a caravan following Dunn’s arrest and a further conspiracy to supply cocaine which was the subject of ongoing proceedings in Bradford Crown Court. In addition, the judge permitted cross-examination about an allegation of money laundering the evidence of which related to 26 June 2003 but which had not and still has not led to any charge against Dunn. Dunn’s answers to these lines of cross-examination were essentially exculpatory. In due course counsel for Gonzales sought to call evidence which would have been inculpatory of Dunn in relation to those matters but the judge would not permit this. The result is that Dunn now complains about having been cross-examined in relation to unproven allegations, whilst Gonzalez complains about the refusal to allow evidence to be called to contradict Dunn’s exculpation. All this gave rise to two further matters of controversy. First, an application was made on behalf of Dunn to the effect that, such was the prejudice accruing to him as a result of the cross-examination about the unproven matters, the only fair course had become to sever the indictment at that stage and to permit him to be tried alone. The judge disagreed and the joint trial continued. Secondly, when Gonzalez gave evidence, the judge permitted counsel for Dunn to cross-examine him not only about his own alleged misconduct, but also about the involvement of Yolanda Tabares and her brothers Diego and John in international cocaine smuggling in the past.
4.
Against this background, both appellants now appeal against conviction by leave of the single judge. It is appropriate to deal with their grounds of appeal sequentially.
1. Dunn:
The ambit of the permitted cross-examination
Section 1
(3)(iii) protects a defendant in the witness box from
“any question tending to show that he has committed or been convicted of or been charged with any offence other than that wherewith he is then charged, or is of bad character, unless –
…….
he has given evidence against any other person charged in the same proceedings.”
Once a defendant has thrown away his shield, it is well known that the judge has no discretion to refuse cross-examination on behalf of the co-defendant against who the defendant witness has given evidence.
5.
At trial it was common ground that, by his answers in cross examination on behalf of the Crown, Dunn had given evidence against Gonzalez and that counsel for Gonzalez should be permitted to re-open his cross examination of Dunn by asking him about his previous convictions. However, it was not accepted on behalf of Dunn that the re-opened cross examination should be permitted to extend to the pending matters of the firearms and the prosecution in Bradford or the evidence giving rise to the allegation of money laundering on 26 June 2003. In its terms
section 1(3)(iii)
extends beyond convictions and to charges and evidence of bad character. In his ruling the judge referred to
Maxwell v. DPP
[1935] AC 309
and the requirement that any cross examination about unproven charges should meet the test of relevance. The judge was satisfied that evidence about the outstanding charges and the allegation of money laundering met the test of relevance, because in each case it was relevant to the credibility of Dunn, whose evidence about the confession on remand was strongly disputed by Gonzalez. Accordingly he permitted the cross-examination to range over the disputed areas, observing that he would return to the question whether any forthcoming evidence might be evidence of propensity at a later point in the trial when Dunn’s answers had become known.
6.
In our judgment the correctness of the ruling of the judge on the ambit of cross-examination of Dunn is beyond dispute. Ultimately, the question was one of relevance and the judge was right to identify relevance as he did.
7.
When counsel for Gonzalez embarked upon the re-opened cross examination, Dunn did not invoke his privilege against self incrimination. He answered the questions in a manner that denied criminality on his part. As to the firearms found in the caravan, he said that he would be maintaining a plea of not guilty, that the caravan was some sixty miles away from his home, and that the person responsible for the firearms (of which he knew nothing) was someone who rented the caravan from him and would be coming forward to admit that the firearms were his rather than Dunn’s. As to the prosecution in Bradford, Dunn said that he was “completely not guilty” and had “absolute evidence and witnesses and photographic evidence that it is nothing to with me. I was 270 miles away at the time of the transaction.” In relation to the questions about money laundering and an allegation that two men had left Dunn’s address carrying a bag containing over £200,000 in cash, he said that there was an innocent explanation and that, in any event, he was in Spain at the time on a stag week. Accordingly, notwithstanding the questions asked, there was no evidence adduced from Dunn to the effect that he was or might be guilty of any of the three matters. Indeed the only evidence was that he was wholly innocent.
2. Dunn: severance
8.
The next question is whether, following the completion of Dunn’s evidence, the judge ought to have acceded to an application for severance on the basis that it was no longer possible for Dunn to receive a fair trial. The point sought to be made on his behalf was that, whilst no evidence of his complicity in the firearms, the Bradford prosecution or the money laundering had emerged, he had been so prejudiced by the questions in the presence of the jury that the only fair course was the exceptional one of severance at that stage.
9.
In his ruling the judge stated that he did not consider it to be an exceptional case. He added:
“There may be unusual features here but this simply does not come into the class of case where I should exercise my discretion to allow a separate trial, not least of which here the charge is one of conspiracy and there are very often in such charges cut throat defences and the single jury must hear all the evidence in relation to all the conspirators, whatever the particular difficulties may be for individual conspirators, and I have come to a decision accordingly. This is a clear case where your client must be tried along with Gonzalez”.
We cannot fault this exercise of judicial discretion. The overall interests of justice pointed overwhelmingly to the need to try Dunn and Gonzalez together.
10.
To complete the picture as far as Dunn is concerned, in due course the judge gave strong directions to the jury in his summing up. He said:
“The only reason why you have heard about his previous convictions is that knowledge of the character of the defendant who has made this attack on his co-defendant may assist you to judge the truthfulness of his evidence when you come to consider the matter. You must not automatically assume either that the defendant is guilty or that he is not telling you the truth just because he has these previous convictions. His convictions are not relevant at all to the likelihood of his having committed the offence, nor are they evidence that the defendant committed the offence for which he stands trial now. They are relevant only as to whether you can believe him. You do not have to allow these convictions to affect your judgment. It is for you to decide the extent to which if at all his previous convictions help you about that…
As to the others matters, the bottom line on all that is that the defendant adamantly states that he is not guilty of some other conspiracy to supply drugs and you have not heard all the evidence nor the full extent of his defence to that matter. You may think that it would be a little unfair to raise an eyebrow and damn him. In any event, as I have already directed you, none of this in any way goes towards his guilt on the charges before you. It is only relevant, if it has any impact at all, upon his credibility.”
In our judgment, this was sufficient to protect Dunn in the circumstances of cut throat defences which had by then developed.
3.
Gonzalez: evidence of Dunn’s propensity
11.
As we have said, when counsel for Gonzalez cross-examined Dunn about the firearms, the Bradford prosecution and the allegation of money-laundering, the answers were exculpatory. As a result, counsel sought to adduce evidence on these issues which would be probative against Dunn and tend to show a propensity for drug dealing on his part. To the extent that the original cross-examination went to credit, it would not be open to Gonzalez to adduce contradictory evidence. However, there is clear authority for the proposition that, whilst it is not generally open to the prosecution to adduce evidence of propensity, there are circumstances, particularly when two defendants are running cut-throat defences, where one defendant may seek to prove the propensity of the other and, in so doing, strengthen the prosecution case against that other, provided that the evidence of propensity is relevant to the issue between the prosecution and the defendant seeking to adduce the evidence.
R v. Randall
[2003] UKHL 69
.
12.
In the present case, the judge refused to permit counsel for Gonzalez to adduce evidence on the disputed matters. Counsel for Gonzalez had argued that the evidence was relevant to the issue of whether the box containing the cocaine was in the bag when it was passed through the window by Gonzalez to Turner. It was possible that the box was not in the bag but was already in the car and belonged to the man with the propensity to drug dealing. Moreover, this would give Dunn a motive to lie about the alleged remand confusion. However, the judge rejected all this as a live issue. He said:
“In my view it is highly speculative to say that the package, admittedly handed over by Gonzalez through the window of the Discovery…..was not the package found in the footwell of the Discovery. Gonzalez does not say that it was not the package of cocaine actually found. His defence…..is a matter of knowledge.
In my judgment it is really, upon a proper analysis, a fantastic speculation to suppose that the package might already have been there. The evidence on which the evidence is said to arise is no more than theoretical and so flimsy that in reality….it is highly speculative and, accordingly, I am firmly of the view that there is no relevance in any propensity of Dunn to traffic in drugs to any issue which adversely affects Gonzalez. The matters upon which Dunn was cross-examined properly go to his credit only and his answers are final on that. Accordingly I disallow the calling of this proposed evidence as it would be inadmissible.”
13.
In our judgment, this careful finding was undoubtedly correct. It accords with
Randall
and the judgment of this Court in
R v. B
(C)
[2004] 2 Cr App R 34
, which was decided shortly after the trial in Maidstone and in which Rix LJ said (at para 45):
“Although, where it is a co-defendant who seeks to introduce the disputed evidence, the test is solely one of relevance and does not involve considerations of discretion or undue prejudice, we do not consider that it can be right that the merest arguability of relevance can be sufficient to require the evidence to be admitted. We say that because ultimately, as Lord Steyn observed in
Randall
, the question of relevance is a matter of degree and this can vary right across the spectrum.”
What this calls for, and what it received at trial in the present case, is a rigorous analysis of relevance. What must not be allowed to happen is for the label of relevance to be attached casually to something the real significance of which is peripheral or non-existent, as a result of which a jury finds itself distracted into assessing evidence in a satellite trial which should be none of its business. The present case affords a good example. If the judge had permitted the evidence to be adduced, the jury would have had to consider the extent of Dunn’s involvement in three other criminal matters. That would hardly have been conducive to the sensible resolution of the real issues in the case it was trying. Happily, the rigorous criterion of relevance came to the rescue.
14.
We are entirely satisfied that the judge was correct to exclude the evidence sought to be adduced on behalf of Gonzalez.
4. Cross-examination of Gonzalez
15.
The final area of controversy relates to the cross-examination of Gonzalez on behalf of Dunn. Following the attack on Dunn’s character, Gonzalez was incontrovertibly exposed to cross-examination about his own bad character. Pre-emptively, he gave evidence in chief about his previous convictions for burglary. However, objection was taken to his being cross-examined about the bad character of his associates and his involvement with them. The disputed material was as follows. He was asked whether he himself had convictions in Spain for cocaine smuggling. He said he had not. He was asked about his involvement with Yolanda Tabares’ brothers in an importation from Venezuela to Tenerife in 1999. He said he knew one but not the other of the brothers but that he had had no involvement with that or any other importation and that he was serving a sentence of imprisonment for burglary in Lanzarote at the time. He totally denied that he had been to Colombia with one of the Tabares brothers to view the cocaine plantations or at all. He also denied all knowledge that Yolanda Tabaras and one of her brothers had been arrested at Heathrow in 1994 when entering this country wearing body belts which contained 10 kilos of cocaine (allegations in respect of which they were later acquitted).
16.
It is not suggested that when counsel for Dunn cross-examined Gonzalez about these matters he lacked the proper material to do so. The complaint is that the questioning ought to have been disallowed or, alternatively, permitted only in the absence of the jury in the first instance so as to ascertain whether the answers would have evidential value. The ruling of the judge was expressed with brevity:
“It seems to me that [counsel] is entitled to pursue this matter. I do not think it would be right to pursue this in the absence of the jury. The jury should hear the evidence.”
17.
When matters unfolded, the answers were no more evidentially valuable than Dunn’s answers had been to the questions about the firearms, the Bradford case and the allegation of money laundering. The scenario was essentially the same – the shield having been lost, cross-examination related to Gonzalez’s previous convictions, charges or bad character in accordance with
section 1(f)(iii)
of
the 1898 Act
. The arrests of the Tabares at Heathrow in 1994 were perhaps marginal but could be said to go to Gonzalez’s own bad character if he had affirmed knowledge of his passenger’s past involvement with cocaine smuggling, even though she had been acquitted (as, by this stage, she had also been in the present case). Be that as it may, all Gonzalez’s answers were exculpatory and the judge eventually directed the jury in these terms:
“Mistakes with regard to a person’s previous convictions are sometimes made and sometimes serious mistakes, but in any event, for the reasons I have already given and sought to emphasise….., you must put questions – and a number of questions were like that in that category - completely out of your mind. Try the case on the actual evidence and not on suggestions which are not backed up by proper evidence.”
18.
It is submitted on behalf of Gonzalez that neither that nor any other direction could have undone the prejudice engendered by the questions asked in cross-examination. We disagree. We do not underestimate the difficulties which arose in this trial from the moment that Dunn gave evidence about the remand confession. Those difficulties were of the kind which often arises when defences become cut throat. They may have taken an accentuated form here and that may be particularly unfortunate when the underlying defence of each defendant was not inconsistent with that of the other. However, the judge dealt with the difficulties appropriately and with aplomb.
5. Gonzalez: disclosure
19.
We have dealt with the grounds of appeal upon which the two appellants were granted leave. There is a further ground upon which Gonzalez was refused leave and which has been referred to before us. We can deal with it summarily. Gonzalez complains that, whilst the prosecution complied with its duties of disclosure under the
Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996
and by reference to
R v H and C
[2004] 2 WLR 335
HL, the requirements of the Act and the House of Lords are not wholly compliant with Article 6 of the ECHR, mainly because they countenance the withholding of material that is neutral or adverse to the case of the defendant. We do not accept that the relevant passage in
H and C
is obiter. We consider ourselves to be bound by it. We refuse this renewed application for leave. It is a matter for Gonzalez whether he wishes to take the point to Strasbourg, as is suggested. We simply record that, in our judgment,
the 1996 Act
and
H and C
are not in conflict with
Edwards v. United Kingdom
(1992) 15 EHHR 417, which was concerned with procedure rather than with the substantive test for disclosure. However, we did not hear full argument on the issue and we say no more about it.
Conclusion
20.
We are unpersuaded by the grounds of appeal which were ably advanced on behalf of both appellants. Neither conviction is unsafe. Both appeals are dismissed. Readers of this judgment may be interested to know that, following his conviction by the jury, Dunn changed his plea to one of guilty in relation to the firearms charge. He was subsequently acquitted in the Bradford case when the prosecution offered no evidence, following a problem with disclosure and public interest immunity. Neither of these later events impacts upon the safety of the conviction of Dunn or of Gonzalez.","citation:

Judgment
MR JUSTICE SWEENEY:
1.
On 27 March 2013 we allowed this appeal against sentence, which was brought by leave of the single judge. The appeal was limited to the issues of whether there should have been a direction under s.240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), as amended by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”), and, if so, how many days spent on qualifying curfew and electronic monitoring conditions should count towards service of the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed upon the appellant in the Crown Court at Leicester on 13 December 2012.
2.
The appeal underlined the problems that can still be encountered in relation to the credit to be given when the offender has been subject to the relevant conditions. In the result, we concluded that a direction should have been given, and ordered that 47 days should count towards service of the appellant’s sentence.
3.
We now give our reasons.
4.
The factual background is, in short, as follows. On 18 May 2012, for an offence of burglary and for two breaches of a non-molestation order the appellant was sentenced by HH Judge Milmo QC, in the Crown Court at Nottingham, to a two year Community Order with a requirement to attend an integrated domestic abuse programme, a six month drug rehabilitation requirement and a six month electronically monitored curfew order.
5.
On 17
th
July 2012, following a breach, the Community Order was extended by two months.
6.
On 13 December 2012 in the Crown Court at Leicester, following a further breach, HH Judge Pert QC revoked the Community Order and re-sentenced the appellant. As we have already noted, a total sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment was imposed.
7.
It is unnecessary to set out the facts of the offences.
8.
There is no doubt that the appellant was on bail, and subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition, for a number of days during the period from 1 February 2012 until he was first sentenced on 18 May 2012.
9.
It is also clear that, in re-sentencing the appellant on 13 December 2012, HH Judge Pert QC intended that the appellant should receive credit for the 38 days that he had spent on remand and for half the number of days that he had spent on bail whilst subject to the relevant conditions. However the judge did not give a direction to that effect because he believed that, following the then recent coming into force of the 2012 Act amendments in relation to sections 240 & 240A of the 2003 Act, no such direction was required as appropriate credit would be given automatically. Equally, whilst an attempt was made thereafter to invite the judge to give a direction in relation to the days spent on bail whilst subject to the relevant conditions, the papers were not placed before him until after the expiry of the 56 day period provided by s.155 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”).
10.
The position before us was further complicated by information that was not before the judge – namely a letter from the Probation Service dated 19 March 2013 asserting that the appellant had breached the terms of the qualifying curfew on a number of the relevant days.
11.
We first make a number of general observations.
12.
As originally enacted, S.240 of the 2003 Act required the court to give a direction as to time spent on remand counting towards a custodial sentence. The difficulties to which that gave rise are notorious.
13.
As to crediting time spent on bail, s.240A of the 2003 Act was inserted by s.21(1) & (4) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (which came into force on 3 November 2008). As originally enacted it provided that:
“Crediting periods of remand on bail…
(1) This section applies where –
(a) a court sentences an offender to imprisonment for a term in respect of an offence committed on or after 4
th
April 2005.
(b) the offender was remanded on bail by a court in course of or in connection with proceedings for the offence, or any related offence, after the coming into force of section 21 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008
(c) the offender’s bail was subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition (“the relevant conditions”)
(2)
Subject to subsection (4) the court must direct that the credit period is to count as the time served by the offender as part of the sentence.
(3)
The “credit period” is the number of days represented by half of the sum of –
The day upon which the offender’s bail was first subject to conditions that, had they applied throughout the day in question, would have been relevant conditions, and
(b) the number of other days on which the offender’s bail was subject to those conditions (excluding the last day on which it was so subject) rounded up to the nearest whole number.
(4)
Subsection (2) does not apply if and to the extent that –
(a) rules made by the Secretary of State so provide, or
(b)
it is in the opinion of the court just in all the circumstances not to give a direction under that subsection.
(5) Where as a result of subparagraph (a) or (b) of subsection (4) the court does not give a direction under subsection (2), it may give a direction in accordance with either of those paragraphs to the effect that a period of days which is less than the credit period is to count as time served by the offender as part of the sentence.
(6)
Rules made under subsection 4(a) may, in particular, make provision in relation to –
(a) sentences of imprisonment for consecutive terms;
(b) sentences of imprisonment for terms which are wholly or partly concurrent;
(c) periods during which a person granted bail is also subject to electronic monitoring required by an order made by a Court of the Secretary of State.
(7)
In considering whether it is of the opinion mentioned in subsection (4)(b) the court must, in particular, take into account whether or not the offender has, at any time whilst on bail subject to the relevant conditions, broken either or both of them
(8)
Where the court gives a direction under subsection (2) or (5) it shall state in open court –
(a)
the number of days on which the offender was subject to the relevant conditions, and
(b)
the number of days in relation to which the direction is given.
(9)
Subsection (10) applies where the court –
(a) does not give a direction under subsection (2) but gives a direction under subsection (5), or
(b) decides not to give a direction under this section.
(10)
The court shall state in open court –
(a) that its decision in accordance with Rules made under paragraph (a) of subsection (4), or
(b) that it is of the opinion mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection and what the circumstances are….
(12)
In this section –
“electronic monitoring condition” means any electronic monitoring requirement imposed under section 3(6ZAA) of the Bail Act 1976 for the purpose of securing the electronic monitoring of a person’s compliance with a qualifying curfew condition;
“qualifying curfew condition” means a condition of bail which requires the person granted bail to remain at one or more specified places for a total of not less than 9 hours in any given day ……”
14.
The rules made under subsection (4)(a) were the Remand on Bail (Disapplication of Credit Period) Rules 2008 (S.I. 2008 no. 2793).
15.
The difficulties to which s.240A (as thus originally enacted) and the Rules gave rise are also notorious.
16.
In
Irving [2010] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 75
, which followed the detailed examination and explanation of the statutory provisions in
Monaghan [2010] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 50
, the Court observed that the general effect of s.240A was that a court was required, when passing sentence, to make a specific order as to the number of days for which credit was to be given – with that number being one-half of the days on which the defendant was subject to a court order for bail containing a condition imposing a curfew for at least nine hours per day and requiring electronic tagging. The court indicated that the problem, as the court had already observed in
Nnaji [2009] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 107
, was that it was not always simple to have the necessary information before the sentencing court and that, in the event of error, and if the error was not corrected within the 56 day period provided by s.155 of the 2000 Act it could only be corrected on appeal – which would inevitably involve the use of valuable administrative time, court time and expense.
17.
Accordingly in
Irving
(above) the court identified four things which, under the provisions then in force, courts and practitioners were required to do, or to take note of, as follows:-
(1)
When passing sentence every judge was required to employ the formula suggested in
Gordon [2007] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 66
, which was simplified in
Nnaji
(above) to the following effect:
“The defendant will receive full credit for the full period of time spent in custody on remand and half the time spent under curfew if the curfew qualified under the provision of s.240A. On the information before me the total period is …. days, but if this period is mistaken, this court will order an amendment of the record for the correct period to be recorded.”
It was underlined that use of the formula would mean that, if an error was made, it could be corrected in the court office even after the expiry of the 56 day period provided by s.155 of the 2000 Act.
(2)
Every court which imposed a curfew and tagging condition was required to use the Court Service form entitled “Record of Electronic Monitoring of Curfew Bail”, which was required to follow the defendant from court to court. It was thus said to be essential, when a defendant was committed or sent to the Crown Court, and either was or had been in the past subject to curfew and tagging, that the form (properly completed) went with his papers to the Crown Court. If the defendant was on bail but had never been the subject of curfew and tagging the magistrates were required to say so, or to send a copy of his bail conditions. If on receipt of a case involving a defendant on bail there was no such form and the question of his status was not clear, then the Crown Court was required to ask the magistrates for clarification and to get hold of the form if it existed.
Solicitors and, if they had not done it, counsel were required to ask the defendant whether he had been subject to curfew and tagging. If he said he had, they were required to find out, from the court record, for which periods. It was the responsibility of the CPS also to have a system for ensuring that such information was available.
(4)
Whether in connection with alleged errors of calculation made under s.240 or s.240A, it ought not to be expected in future that the Court would routinely grant long extensions of time when no one had applied his mind to the issue until long after the event.
18.
Finally, the Court in
Irving
urged Parliament to consider making changes to sections 240 and 240A as soon as a convenient opportunity presented itself – so that continuing undesirable consequences could be avoided in the future.
19.
In
Williams
[2012] EWCA Crim 1590
, which was concerned with time spent on remand, the Court indicated that the form of words used in
Irving
(above) should always be used, even if all parties believed that there were no days to count.
20.
Sections 108 and 109 of the 2012 Act came into force on 3 December 2012 – i.e. ten days before sentences was passed in this case.
21.
Section 108, which by virtue of paragraph 2(1)(a) of Schedule 15 to the 2012 Act applies in relation to any person who falls to be released under Chapter 6 of Part 12 the 2003 Act on or after the commencement date, removes s.240 of the 2003 Act altogether and inserts in its place s.240ZA – which provides a scheme for the crediting of time on remand in custody to be dealt with administratively.
22.
Section 109, which by virtue of paragraph 3(a) of Schedule 15 to the 2012 Act applies in relation to any person sentenced on or after the commencement date, combined with s.121(5) and paragraphs 13 and 14 of Schedule 16 to the 2012 Act, amends s.240A of the 2003 Act so that it now provides as follows:-
“Time remanded on bail to count towards time served….
(1) This section applies where –
a) A court sentences an offender to imprisonment for a term in respect of an offence
b)
The offender was remanded on bail by a court in course of or in connection with proceedings for the offence, or any related offence, after the coming into force of section 21 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, and
c)
The offender’s bail was subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition (“the relevant conditions”).
(1)
Subject to subsections (3A) and (3B) the court must direct that the credit period is to count as time served by the offender as part of the sentence
The credit period is calculated by taking the following steps.
Step 1
Add –
a) The day on which the offender’s bail was first subject to the relevant conditions (and for this purpose a condition is not prevented from being a relevant condition by the fact that it does not apply for the whole of the day in question), and
b) The number of other days on which the offender’s bail was subject to those conditions (but excludes the last of those days if the offender spends the last part of it in custody).
Step 2
Deduct the number of days on which the offender, whilst on bail subject to the relevant conditions, was also –
a)
subject to any requirement imposed for the purpose of securing the electronic monitoring of the offender’s compliance with a curfew requirement, or
b)
on temporary release under rules made under section 47 of the Prison Act 1952.
Step 3
From the remainder, deduct the number of days during that remainder on which the offender has broken either or both of the relevant conditions.
Step 4
Divide the result by 2
Step 5
If necessary, round up to the nearest whole number.
(3A)
A day of the credit period counts as time served –
a)
in relation to any one sentence
b) only once in relation to that sentence.
(3B) A day of credit is not to count as time served as part of any period of 28 days served by the offender before automatic release (see section 255B(1)).
(8)
Where the court gives a direction under subsection (2) it shall state in open court -
a)
the number of days on which the offender was subject to the relevant conditions, and
b)
the number of days (if any) which it deducted under each of Steps 2 and 3…….
(12)
In this section-
“curfew requirement” means a requirement (however described) to remain at one or more specified places for a specified number of hours in any given day, provided that the requirement is imposed by a court or the Secretary of State and arises as a result of a conviction.
“electronic monitoring condition” means any electronic monitoring of a person’s compliance with a qualifying curfew condition.
“qualifying curfew condition” means a condition of bail which requires the person granted bail to remain at one or more specified places for a total of not less than 9 hours in any given day.”
23.
It can thus be seen, amongst other things, that:-
(1)
In contrast to s.240ZA, there is no automatic deduction of days spent on bail subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition.
(2) The discretion, formerly provided by the combination of subsections 4(b) (5) and (7), not to give a direction at all, or to give a direction as to a period of days less than the credit period, has gone.
(3)
Instead, there is now a requirement under subsection (2) that, subject to subsections (3A) and (3B), the court must direct that the credit period is to count as time served.
(4)
Subsection (3A) prevents the same remand time counting several times against two or more sentences (whether they are to be served concurrently or consecutively)
(5)
Subsection (3B) prevents remand time shortening any ‘fixed term recall’ under s.255B (which was introduced by the 2008 Act).
(6)
Step 2 in subsection (3) prevents credit for tagged bail counting towards a subsequent sentence for such time as the defendant was also subject to an electronically monitored curfew requirement in connection with any other sentence (which includes being released on Home Detention Curfew) or had been temporarily released from prison in relation to another sentence.
(7)
Step 3 in subsection (3) prevents credit for days on which the defendant breached either the qualifying curfew condition or the electronic monitoring condition.
(8)
Under subsection (8), when a direction is given the court must state in open court the number of days on which the offender was subject to the relevant conditions, and the number of days (if any) which it has deducted under Steps 2 and 3.
24.
Against that background, and in view of the guidance previously given in
Irving
and in
Williams
(above) it seems to us that:
It remains essential that every court which imposes a curfew and tagging condition uses the Court Service form entitled ‘Record of Electronic Monitoring of Curfew Bail’ (or its up-to-date equivalent) which is required to follow the defendant from court to court. When a defendant is sent or committed to the Crown Court then the form (properly completed) must go with the papers to the Crown Court. If the defendant has never been subject to curfew and tagging the magistrates are required to say so, or to send a copy of his bail conditions. If on receipt of a case involving a defendant on bail there is no such form and the question of his status is not clear, then the Crown Court must ask the magistrates for clarification and get hold of the form if it exists.
(1)
Solicitors and, if they have not done it, counsel are required to ask the defendant whether he has been subject to curfew and tagging. If he says that he has, they are required to find out, from the court record, for which periods. It is also the responsibility of the CPS to have a system for ensuring that such information is available.
(2)
Compliance with above-mentioned requirements should ensure that Step 1 is relatively straightforward.
(3)
In any event, the consideration of Steps 1 – 3 will be part of the post-conviction proceedings and thus not subject to the invariable application of strict rules of evidence. The approach to admissibility, particularly in relation to hearsay evidence, should be that identified in
Clipston [2011] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 101
– with emphasis upon the procedures adopted to deal with Steps 1-3 being both flexible and fair.
(4)
Nevertheless, if there is a dispute under, in particular, Step 2 and/or Step 3, then the prosecution must prove to the criminal standard that the days sought to be deducted from the number of days identified under Step 1 are caught by the relevant Step.
(5)
However, if the court is of the opinion that the resolution of the dispute, or part of it, would be likely to amount to the disproportionate use of time and expense then (without more) the dispute, or the relevant part of it, should be resolved in the defendant’s favour and no deduction made from the number of days identified under Step 1. The court is only likely to be of such an opinion if the number of days involved is relatively modest.
(6)
The court will then deal with the maths required by Steps 4 and 5 and will thereafter give a direction – complying in the process with subsection (8).
(7)
Save in a case where it is clear that there is no possibility of crediting a period of remand on bail, the order of the court should, in accordance with
Nnaji
and
Williams
, be along the following lines:
“The defendant will receive full credit for half the time spent under curfew if the curfew qualified under the provisions of s.240A. On the information before me the total period is … days (subject to the deduction of ... days that I have directed under Step(s) 2 and/or 3 making a total of … days), but if this period is mistaken, this Court will order an amendment of the record for the correct period to be recorded.”
(8)
It remains the case that it ought not to be expected that this Court will routinely grant long extensions of time to correct errors when no one has applied his mind to the issue until long after the event.
25.
As to the instant case, the judge was clearly right to conclude that, in accordance with s.240ZA, the 38 days which the appellant had spent on remand in custody would automatically count towards the service of his sentence. However, the judge erred in concluding that, likewise, no direction was required in relation to the days that the appellant had spent on bail whilst subject to qualifying curfew and electronic monitoring conditions. A direction complying with s.240A (as now amended) was required. We therefore considered s.240A(3) Steps 1-5. Under Step 1 we identified a period of 94 days. There was nothing to suggest the need for a deduction from that total under Step 2. However, the letter from the Probation Service dated 19 March 2013 (to which we have already made reference) raised the issue, under Step 3, of whether the appellant had broken either or both of the relevant conditions on a total of 8 of the 94 days. The alleged breaches were denied. The net credit in dispute was thus 4 days. In the particular circumstances of this case resolution of the dispute would have required an adjournment, the attendance of the prosecution, and the likely calling of evidence. We concluded that such further proceedings would be likely to amount to a disproportionate use of time and expense. Accordingly we resolved the dispute in the appellant’s favour and, having applied Steps 4 & 5, ordered (as indicated above) that 47 days should count towards the service of his sentence.","citation:

1.
LORD JUSTICE STANLEY BURNTON: On 11th December 2009, at Southwark Crown Court before His Honour Judge Stone QC and a jury, the appellant was convicted by a majority of sexual assault and he was subsequently sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. The normal order of Schedule 3 of the Sexual Offences Act applied and he was ordered to pay a sum by way of costs. He appeals against his conviction by leave of the single judge.
2.
The incident which formed the subject of the indictment took place in the early hours of 21st November 2008 on a train that began at Kings Cross St Pancras Station in London and went at least to St Albans, if not beyond. Both the appellant and the complainant boarded that train at about 3.20 in the morning. They had both been waiting on the platform. The complainant had been sleeping on the platform bench for some time. The appellant sat down next to her a few minutes before the train arrived. The complainant is a young lady who had been drinking earlier in the evening. She entered the first carriage and sat down next to the window in the first set of four seats. There was one other person in the carriage and he was asleep. Shortly afterwards the appellant, who had entered the third or fourth carriage, walked back through the train and entered her carriage and sat down on the sit opposite her. She was resting her foot on the seat opposite. The prosecution case was that the appellant proceeded to take hold of the foot and massage it and continued to engage in what was in fact sexual activity towards her until he got off the train at Mill Hill station. She remained on the train until St Albans.
3.
When she got off the train she caught a taxi to go to the police station. She found it was closed. She rang her mother in a state of some distress and then rang the police. She complained on the telephone to the police that the appellant had molested her on the train.
4.
The appellant attended the police station, where he was arrested and interviewed subsequently. He declined to answer any questions put to him and relied on a prepared statement, which read: ""I wish to deny the allegation of sexual assault which occurred on a train between St Pancras International and Mill Hill Broadway stations on 21st November 2008.” In March 2009 he returned to the police station following the discovery of semen bearing his DNA on a sock of the complainant. He was told of that and was interviewed for a second time. He again declined to answer any questions put to him. He again relied on a prepared statement, which read: ""I wish to deny the allegation of sexual assault, save to say that any sexual touching was by the consent of both parties.""
5.
The case for the prosecution was that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant by touching her thigh, bottom and groin and placing her hand on his penis. He knew she had not consented to such sexual activity as she kept pulling away from him. His case was that she had consented to his massaging her foot. Apart from that, there was no sexual contact between them. He had masturbated himself. She had not objected, indeed consented, following which he touched her foot which resulted in his DNA being found on her sock.
6.
The principal and crucial evidence of course was that of the complainant, who described how she had got on the train, where she had sat, that a man had entered the carriage and sat down opposite her, that of course, it was common ground, was the appellant. She described what he had done in terms of picking up her foot and putting it in his lap and so on. She said she felt uncomfortable and did not want to make a scene and pretended to fall asleep again. He had rubbed her foot up and down his inner thigh and into his groin before putting her sock and shoe back on. She said she was tired and groggy and did not remember him removing her sock and she had found him rubbing his hand up and down her thigh. He leant forward and rubbed her bottom with his left hand before touching her groin and around her vagina. She said that she forcefully moved away from him and then pulled up her legs so that she was curled up in a ball on the seat. He moved onto the seat next to her, took hold of her hand and began stroking it. She described what had happened, including his forcing her hand into his groin and trying to put her hand into his trousers. She thought that she had felt his penis. He got off the train at Mill Hill station. She said that she was upset once he got off the train. When she got off the train, and it was shown from CCTV, she did not attempt to speak to any staff who were on the platform at St Albans, but her evidence that she had gone to the police station in a taxi was not challenged. The police station was closed, it being the middle of the night. She then spoke to her mother, following which she made a complaint to the police.
7.
Her mother also gave evidence, as did the appellant. His case was that, although he had never met the complainant before, she had agreed to what had taken place, including his masturbating himself which resulted in his ejaculation. Throughout what had occurred there was no indication on the part of the complainant that she was unhappy. In brief, his defence was consent.
8.
The complainant was cross-examined at some length. There were undoubtedly a number of inconsistencies in her evidence, in particular as to whether or not she fell asleep during the journey between Kings Cross St Pancras and Mill Hill and whether she knew that her sock had been taken off or not. On her evidence also there was no explanation of how the semen came to be on her sock, which undoubtedly it did. It is also said that she had an opportunity while on the train after the appellant had left the train to inform her mother what had happened. She received a text message from her mother asking about her and whether she was all right and her reply was simply ""I am on the train on the way home"", and it was only after she had arrived at St Albans that there appears to have been any complaint.
9.
The ground of the appeal is that the summing-up was unfair, unbalanced and failed to direct the jury and to remind the jury of the significant points made on behalf of the appellant during the cross-examination. We accept that this summing was a defective -- indeed, a very defective -- summing-up. The appellant was entitled to have the jury reminded by the judge in the summing-up of the significant points made during the course of the cross-examination of the complainant, and in particular on any matters which would indicate unreliability in her evidence, and we have just referred to the principal ones relied on on this appeal.
10.
It is said on behalf of the prosecution that the summing-up was balanced because the judge did not remind the jury of the cross-examination of the appellant either. That does not cure the defect in the summing-up resulting from his failure to deal with the cross-examination of the complainant.
11.
The summing-up was so defective that the judge did not, until reminded by counsel, direct the jury as to the burden and standard of proof required in a case such as this. Happily, that defect in the summing was remedied. But when asked by Miss O'Connor, who quite properly complained to the judge that the points she had made during her cross-examination of the complainant had not been put to the jury, the judge said, astonishingly, that it was not his practice to do so. So on this appeal the appellant starts from the position in which we accept that the summing-up was defective.
12.
However, the question for us is whether the conviction was unsafe. It is true that there were inconsistencies in the account of the complainant. However, all the points that have been made so powerfully before us today by Miss O'Connor were made during the course of cross-examination, and no doubt in her speech. The complainant had given evidence on a Tuesday, 8th December. The appellant had given evidence on the following day and the summing-up was on Thursday, 10th December, so that all these points and the evidence in cross-examination of the appellant would have been fresh in the minds of the jury. The case against the appellant was very powerful indeed. On his case, a young lady in the early hours of the morning, admittedly having had some drink, gets into a train and begins a sexual encounter with a man considerably older for no reason at all. Having agreed to a sexual encounter, she gets off the train and almost the first thing she does is to take a taxi to the police station. She is thereafter in a state of distress, and it is difficult to see of any reason why, if she had agreed to a sexual encounter, she should then have gone to the police station.
13.
In our judgment, although the complaints as to the summing-up are well-founded, this is a case in which the matters relied on are of a kind which would have been fully in the mind of the jury. The case against the appellant being so powerful, we have no doubt that this conviction was and is safe notwithstanding the defects in this summing-up. The vagaries in the evidence of the complainant are not surprising having regard to the fact that this matter happened when she had had some drink, when she was tired and when no doubt, on her case at least, there was a degree of concern, worry and tension as to what was happening to her. It is not to be expected that there will be perfect recollection in such circumstances. The issue in this case was not precisely what had happened, nor was there the issue as to whether or not there had been a sexual encounter, the only issue was consent. So far as that is concerned, the evidence, in our judgment, was overwhelming. In those circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.","citation:

If this transcript is to be reported or published, there is a requirement to ensure that no reporting restriction will be breached. This is particularly important in relation to any case involving a sexual offence, where the victim is guaranteed lifetime anonymity (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992), or where an order has been made in relation to a young person.
1.
MR JUSTICE EDIS: Conner Mariscotti is now 19 years old. Having admitted five offences before the Magistrates' Court on 17 October 2017 he was committed for sentence pursuant to section 3 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. That committal was dealt with at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 10 November 2017 when a total sentence of 32 months' detention in a young offender institution was imposed, against which he now appeals by leave of the single judge.
2.
The offences were all offences of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs, contrary to section 5(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Count 1 related to class A drugs (cocaine). Count 2 related to class A drugs (ecstasy). Count 3 related to class A drugs (LSD). Counts 4 and 5 related to class B drugs (cannabis). Sentences of 32 months in respect of each of the class A counts were imposed concurrently and sentences of eight months' detention were imposed concurrently also in respect of the two cannabis offences. Certain further orders were made, on which nothing now turns.
3.
These offences came to light when the police went on other wholly unrelated business to the home of the appellant on 23 August 2016. While they were there they looked under his bed and found quantities of drugs. There was herbal cannabis and a small bag of cannabis resin in a black rucksack: 408 milligrams of herbal cannabis and 2.91 grams of resinous cannabis. That resulted in the two counts relating to cannabis. They also found a quantity of white powder, some coloured tablets, some brown looking substance and a large quantity of self-seal bags. These were analysed as turned out to be the class A drugs: 1.4 grams of cocaine, four packages of ecstasy totalling 3.99 grams in 19 tablets of ecstasy and some further tablets differently coloured but of the same substance. There were two packages which turned out to be LSD and eight doses in eight packages of the same amount partially compressed in a white crystallised form. The value of the drugs was put at a street valuation at £1,724 all in. On examination some texts were found on his telephone which were relevant to drug dealing involving cannabis.
4.
The appellant has limited criminal convictions and has no criminal conviction for any offence involving controlled drugs.
5.
There was before the judge a pre-sentence report and addendum which had been prepared for other proceedings and which dated back in the case of the substantive report to 27 April 2017 and of the addendum to 16 June 2017, which gave an assessment of the appellant, as well as an assessment of the offences for which they had been prepared.
6.
The proceedings took the following course. It became clear at the first hearing in the Crown Court that there was an issue of fact between the prosecution and the appellant. The question was whether he had those drugs in order to supply them to friends on a non-commercial basis or whether he had them in order to sell them commercially. The judge decided that it was necessary for that to be resolved and a hearing was held for that purpose. The hearing took the usual form in that the judge had available the evidence on which the prosecution relied and the appellant gave evidence on oath and was cross-examined in which he supported or sought to support his account of his social only supplying. The judge rejected that evidence. He said that the quantities of class A drugs in this case were the kind of quantities that street dealers generally have available to them, although they do not normally carry that amount on the street when they are dealing. He accepted that the text messages relating to drug dealing on the mobile phone related to dealing in cannabis and did not therefore themselves establish that he had in his possession any class A drugs for the purpose of commercial supply. However, the judge said that having heard him the appellant is not a credible witness and the judge did not believe a word he had said, other than when he was talking most movingly about the bereavement that he suffered when he lost his mother when he was a child. Having reached that conclusion the court found that the appellant was dealing commercially in a very small way in class A and class B drugs. He was, as the judge put it, selling them on a hand to mouth basis. He was entirely sure that the class A drugs were in his possession for selling. The cocaine was divided into packages. The other class A drugs were also split into saleable quantities. He rejected therefore the mitigating account given by the appellant.
7.
That means, as is accepted by Mr Manning, who appears on behalf of the appellant before us and indeed appeared on his behalf before the judge, that when considering the relevant guideline the appropriate category of harm is Category 3 street dealing. Although the appellant was not actually in the course of selling on the street when he was arrested, he was arrested with his small stock from which he would subsequently intend to draw saleable quantities and take them out into the street. He was therefore a street dealer.
8.
The next exercise required of the judge by the guideline was an assessment of culpability demonstrated by role. In this case the role was either significant or lesser. The judge observed that he did not have a supervisory role because he was effectively running his own little business storing the trade goods at his home. The judge said that that was a significant role. That finding is challenged in a way to which we shall shortly turn.
9.
The judge then selected a starting point from the appropriate category for class 3 significant role of four years. The starting point in the guideline is four years six months and the range is three years six months to seven years. The judge had therefore selected a shorter starting point before plea discount than the guideline suggested. In doing so he sought to reflect both the size of the business which the appellant was running and also the mitigating features.
10.
Having gone through that second step in the guideline, the judge then moved to step 4, reduction for guilty pleas, and allowed full credit. This was, we note, an act of some generosity since the relevant guideline for credit for plea guilty pleas suggests that normally that amount of credit should be reduced by half where there has been a failed
Newton
hearing, as here. The one-third discount however was applied reducing the four year starting point before plea discount to the sentences which we have already set out of 32 months.
11.
Mr Manning has drafted and advanced two grounds of appeal. First, he says that the judge erred in treating the appellant as having played a significant role and therefore took too high a starting point. Had the judge been able to say that this was a lesser role, the starting point would have been three years in the guideline and the range two to four years and inevitably the sentence would have been less. The second ground is that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to mitigating factors, which includes a procedural submission to which we shall return.
12.
The single judge considering those two grounds which were before him on paper and which have been expanded before us orally, refused leave on the first ground but granted leave on the second. He did so on a particular basis which it is appropriate to set out. He said this:
""Although the procedure set out in the Criminal Practice Direction for dealing with a Newton hearing was not followed, the issue which the judge had to resolve was within a very narrow compass and was clearly defined so that everyone engaged in the hearing was aware of it. There was no injustice. The judge heard the evidence and his conclusion that you were dealing in drugs for profit, albeit on a comparatively small scale, is unassailable. You fall within the category of 'significant role' in the Guidelines.
The judge said he would have imposed a total sentence of 4 years after a trial and from that he deducted a full one-third discount for your guilty pleas even after a Newton hearing in which your basis of plea had been rejected. The resulting sentence of 32 months in total for dealing in five different types of drugs is well within the acceptable range of sentences for offending of this nature. If matters stood there I would not have granted you leave to appeal.
I grant leave, however, for the full court to review your sentence because your counsel says he was not given a proper opportunity to address the judge in mitigation on your behalf. You should not be optimistic about the result of your appeal. The full court might conclude that whatever the procedural shortcomings might be, your sentence is not manifestly excessive.""
13.
We entirely agree with the single judge in refusing leave to argue Mr Manning's first ground of appeal. If you are running your own business, your role in it is significant. The fact that it is a small business is to be reflected in other ways in applying the guidelines to the facts of the case in accordance with the approach identified by this court in
R v Healey
[2012] EWCA Crim. 1005
,
[2013] 1 Cr.App.R (S) 33
. It is impossible to describe a sole trader as having an insignificant role in his own business. Big or small, he is it.
14.
We therefore confine ourselves to the issue on which the single judge granted leave and briefly explain the circumstances. The judge heard the appellant in evidence and heard submissions about the issue which was live in the
Newton
hearing and reached a conclusion about it. However, what he did not do was to pause, announce his factual findings and then invite mitigation to be addressed to him by Mr Manning. He said:
""I am afraid Mr Mariscotti was an entirely unconvincing witness and I have no difficulty rejecting his account. Stand up then Mr Mariscotti in respect of each of the counts of possession with intent to supply ... ""
In other words, there was no pause for particular consideration of the items of mitigation which this appellant may be able to deploy in seeking to reduce the sentence before plea discount below four years.
15.
We have therefore allowed Mr Manning to advance those matters of mitigation that he would have advanced before the judge had matters proceeded differently. There are eight points. First, he refers to the effect of the bereavement resulting from the death of his mother on the appellant. It has a continuing effect on his ability to form relationships. Secondly, he has no previous convictions. Thirdly, Mr Manning in-appositely, in our judgment, refers us to the credit for plea. That issue comes later, as we shall say. Fourthly, he refers to the co-operation with the police which effectively involves not disrupting or seeking to disrupt their search. Fifthly, his age. Sixthly, his limited intelligence. Seventhly, a letter of remorse which he had written to the judge. We observe that a defendant who gives evidence which is rejected at a
Newton
hearing can hardly be said to be overburdened with remorse in any ordinary use of the word. Eighthly, he was actively seeking employment. Mr Manning says that he would have asked the judge at that stage to order a pre-sentence report and it was conceivable that that might have resulted in a further reduction in the sentence.
16.
We accept that in the ordinary run of events there is generally a pause for some mitigation following the announcement of the findings of fact of the judge at a
Newton
hearing. That is not an invariable procedure. If the judge has sufficient information about the mitigation which has been presented to him, so that he is aware of all relevant points, then it may be possible to proceed as the judge did here. Whether that is right or wrong, the opportunity afforded to the appellant in this court amply rectifies any injustice which may have occurred.
17.
It is clear that all of those matters now advanced before us were well-known to the judge who had the papers and who had read to him the letter of remorse and who had just heard the appellant give evidence about himself and about his background and about the loss of his mother.
18.
In those circumstances, it is simply not the case that the judge was unaware of anything significant which might have exerted any downward traction on this sentence. So far as the pre-sentence report is concerned, in our judgment the judge having read the documents to which we have referred dating back to 2017 was very well placed indeed to appreciate that no further such document was likely to contain anything which would impact on this sentence for what is, after all, commercial dealing in a variety of class A drugs.
19.
We therefore have addressed the concern which troubled the single judge but find as a result of that exercise that there is no mitigation available to this appellant which would be capable of reducing the sentence before plea discount below four years. But even if that is wrong, there is a margin in this case in favour of the appellant because the judge gave, in our judgment, unduly generous credit for the plea of guilty. Instead of allowing full credit of 16 months he should have allowed half credit of eight months. In so doing he was no doubt attempting to reflect further all the matters which might usefully be prayed in aid on behalf of this appellant.
20.
At all events, however the sentence was arrived at, it is, in our judgment, impossible to say that on the facts of this case it is arguable that a sentence of 32 months in all was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.

    Comment: offender admitting to lesser offence (social use, not intent to supply)
    Exact: The question was whether he had those drugs in order to supply them to friends on a non-commercial basis or whether he had them in order to sell them commercially. The judge decided that it was necessary for that to be resolved and a hearing was held for that purpose. The hearing took the usual form in that the judge had available the evidence on which the prosecution relied and the appellant gave evidence on oath and was cross-examined

1.
LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: This offender (now aged 40) pleaded guilty to three offences of cruelty to a person under 16 years contrary to
section 1(1)
of the
Children and Young Persons Act 1933
.  On 15 December 2021 in the Crown Court at Manchester (Minshull Street) he was sentenced by HHJ Nield to a total of 3 years 4 months' imprisonment.  Her Majesty's Solicitor General believes that sentence to be unduly lenient.  Application is accordingly made, pursuant to
section 36
of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
, for leave to refer the case to this Court so that the sentencing may be reviewed.
2.
The victim of the offences is the offender's daughter, aged 13 during the period covered by the indictment.  To protect her, an order pursuant to
section 45
of the
Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999
was made in the Crown Court.  It provides that no matter relating to her shall, whilst she is under the age of 18, be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify her as a person concerned in these proceedings.  This prohibition extends in particular to her name, her address, the identity of any school or other educational establishment attended by her, the identity of any place of work and any still or moving picture of her.  That order remains in force and we confirm that it applies to any report of this application.  We will therefore refer to her simply as ""V"".  It would defeat the purpose of that order if the offender were to be named in any report which also identified his paternal relationship.  We shall accordingly refer to him simply as ""the offender"" and we direct that in any report of these proceedings he must be anonymised by using the randomly chosen letters ""ALS"".  We shall refer to a witness in the case (a former partner of the offender) as ""L"".
3.
As a young child, V had lived with her mother.  The offender had struggled with alcohol dependency.  When V was aged 10, and the offender had recently completed a detoxification, V was placed in his care.  It is apparent from all we have read that the offender wanted to care properly for his daughter and did his best to do so.  For a time, all was well.  V's attendance at school improved, reports from the school about her were positive and the local Children's Services were able to end their involvement.
4.
Sadly the relationship between father and daughter began to break down, and they fell into frequent arguing.  The offender used violence against V.  Count 1 charged an offence of cruelty between 22 May 2018 and 3 March 2021, the particulars being that he wilfully ill-treated V by undertaking excessive chastisement and isolating her from her school and friends.
5.
When lockdown began, the offender was furloughed from his employment for a lengthy period.  He struggled with caring for and home-educating V.  It seems that he slid back into his former problems, and became increasingly prone to violent outbursts of temper against V.  These came to light on 16 March 2021 when L visited the offender and saw V obviously injured and in considerable distress.  On the following day L informed the police.
6.
Counts 2 and 3 were charges of cruelty relating to the period between 4 and 17 March 2021.  Count 2 related to wilful assaults on V, count 3 related to wilful neglect of V by failing to secure medical treatment for the injuries which the offender had inflicted.
7.
V was medically examined.  We have read the medical evidence and seen the photographs.  There were at least 48 injuries.  It is no exaggeration to say that V was covered with bruises.  In addition to the bruising of her face, body and limbs her right eye was very swollen with conjunctival hematoma.  Her jaw was so painful that she was unable to eat solids and had been living off soup.  Her left hand was painful and swollen, and X-ray confirmed a fracture.  That injury has resulted in a continuing deformity, with the left little finger permanently bent.
8.
V described how the offender had frequently beaten her when he thought she had done something wrong.  He would hit her until she agreed with him that she was in the wrong, even if she was not, and she therefore made false admissions in order to stop the assault.  About 2 weeks before the intervention of the police he had wrongly accused her of something she had not done, and had punched her all over.  He hit her with a cable and then tried to strangle her with it.  V managed to prevent him from doing so, and he instead put his hand round her throat, choking her until she could not breathe.  He then continued to punch her face.  She raised her hands to protect herself and he hit her left hand, causing the fracture to which we have referred.  V said that on another occasion he had used a different weapon, hitting her on the head with a ruler.
9.
V said that she had hidden her injuries, mainly by staying home from school.  She had never told anybody about the beatings, and did not want her father to get into trouble.   She said that he would always say sorry, would tell her that he knew he was doing wrong and would give her painkillers.
10.
The offender himself made admissions as to what he had done.  When challenged by L on 16 March 2021 about the injuries to V which were visible that day, he said that he had ""battered her over a few days"".  He went on to say that V had looked at him in a funny way, so he had “battered” her again; and he had then “battered” her yet again because she had disrespected him by not doing what he told her to do.  The following morning, when further bruising was seen by L, the offender graphically listed what had done: ""I've punched her, I've kicked her, I've kneed her, I've strangled her with a charging wire, I've pushed her, I've bit her"".  He went on to say to L: ""What you don't understand, when I'm in a rage fight mode takes over and it doesn't matter who you are"".  He added: ""Something would normally trigger me to stop but she looked at me funny and I would go back into fight mode"".  Having heard this, L contacted the police.
11.
The offender was arrested and interviewed under caution.  He made no comment.  He was charged with the offences and on 22 March 2021 was sent for trial.  No indication of plea was given at the magistrates' court.  The Better Case Management form records that he had been advised as to credit for plea, but the box providing an opportunity to indicate pleas had been left blank.
12.
At a PTPH in the Crown Court on 16 April 2021 the offender indicated pleas to counts 2 and 3.  The hearing was adjourned to allow counsel to have a full conference and on 4 May 2021 he entered his guilty pleas.  He initially did so on a basis which was not accepted by the prosecution, but this was later amended to a basis which was accepted.
13.
The offender had previously been sentenced on 22 separate occasions for a total of 48 offences.  Ten of those were offences of violence and a further three had related to weapons.  His last conviction in 2015 was for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and battery upon L, for which he had received a custodial sentence.
14.
Following the intervention of the police, V went to live with her aunt.  A victim personal statement by the aunt described V's frightened state and constant fear that she would be beaten.  As a result of the circumstances in which she had been living, V at first found it difficult to accept that she was allowed a choice in things.  The statement indicated that V was adapting well to her new life.
15.
The judge was assisted by a pre-sentence report.  The author felt that the problems caused by lockdown, including difficulties in the offender's accessing services coupled with the offender's deteriorating mental health, had contributed to the commission of the offences.  The offender had accepted full responsibility and had volunteered what the author described as ""full and unprompted"" expressions of remorse.  The author assessed these as genuine.
16.
The offender himself had written a letter to the court.  He described the progress he had made in overcoming his alcoholism in the past, reaching the stage where he had been accepted for an apprenticeship and was both working and caring for V.  Those commitments, he said, had caused him to neglect his addiction programme, which had become a problem when he was furloughed during lockdown.  He expressed his great remorse for having, as he put it, ""taken out my problems on the ones I love"".
17.
L had also written to the court.  She too described how the offender had turned his life around after a period of residential rehabilitation and commended his success in providing, for a time, a home for V which was more stable than any V had endured at any other time in her life.  During lockdown, L said, the offender had been without support when he needed it most.
18.
The judge observed that it was an appalling case of significant cruelty to a vulnerable young girl, who was already emotionally damaged and who was at the time wholly reliant on the offender.  She assessed count 2, which involved prolonged and multiple incidents of serious cruelty, as falling into category 1A of the Sentencing Council's relevant definitive guideline, with a starting point of 6 years' custody and a range from 4 to 8 years.  She considered whether the offender was dangerous, but noted the significant period of time which had elapsed since his last conviction for violence and concluded that in any event an extended determinate sentence would not be necessary.  The judge accepted that the offender was genuinely remorseful, and also accepted that lockdown had brought to the fore frailties which she felt should perhaps have been identified earlier during V's placement with her father.
19.
Having regard to what was said in the pre-sentence report, the judge concluded that the guideline starting point should be lowered to a sentence of 5 years before reduction for guilty plea.  She allowed full credit for all the guilty pleas and so imposed a sentence of 3 years 4 months' imprisonment on this count.  In reaching that decision she treated the count 3 offence as an aggravating feature of count 2, and therefore imposed no separate penalty on count 3.  On count 1 she imposed a concurrent sentence of 12 months.  Thus the total sentence was, as we have said, 3 years 4 months' imprisonment.
20.
On behalf of Her Majesty's Solicitor General, Mr Lloyd submits that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the prolonged course of incidents of serious cruelty, the presence of many high culpability factors relevant to count 2, the aggravating feature of the previous convictions, including previous domestic assaults, and the failure to seek medical treatment charged in count 3.  The combination of those features, he submits, should have resulted in a substantial adjustment above the guideline starting point for count 2, before considering the mitigating factors of remorse, mental health issues and personal mitigation.  Mr Lloyd adds that the offender should not have received full credit for his guilty pleas, which were not indicated at the first opportunity.  He submits that the total sentence was for those reasons unduly lenient.
21.
Ms Henshaw submits on behalf of the offender that the sentence was not unduly lenient.  She accepts that count 2 fell into category 1A of the guideline, but submits that factors of medium culpability and harm were also present and that the guideline starting point was therefore properly reduced by the judge.  She submits that the offender had succeeded in making substantial progress in his recovery from alcoholism and in overcoming his past problems, but his mental health relapsed in the circumstances thrust upon him by lockdown and by the lack of support available to him during that difficult period.  Ms Henshaw recognises the aggravating feature of the previous convictions, but points out that the most recent of them was sustained before the residential rehabilitation which for a time succeeded in turning the offender's life around.  She submits that the judge rightly took into account the substantial mitigation and balanced it against the acknowledged seriousness of the offence.  She also reminds us of the particular difficulties faced by prisoners during the pandemic.
22.
We are grateful to both counsel for the clarity of their written and oral submissions.  Having reflected upon them, our conclusions are as follows.  Like the judge, we recognise that the offender had made substantial efforts to turn his life around and deserves credit for the success with which he did so.  We accept that the offences were committed during a period which many people found very difficult and which was particularly difficult for a man with the offender's problems and limitations.  No one doubts his remorse.  Nor is there any reason to doubt that he loves his daughter, and we recognise that the inevitable separation from her will be a source of lasting distress to him.  The judge was right to recognise, and to give significant weight to, the substantial personal mitigation available to the offender.
23.
We hesitate to differ from the view taken by the judge, who has long experience in both the criminal and family jurisdictions and was careful to ensure that she was equipped with all the information relevant to sentence.  However with all respect to the judge, we accept the submission on behalf of the Solicitor General that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the offender's culpability and the aggravating features of the case.  Of the seven characteristics of high culpability listed in the guideline, at least four – namely, prolonged and multiple incidents of serious cruelty, the use of very significant force, the use of a weapon and the deliberate disregard for the welfare of the victim - were present.  In our view, the incident of attempted strangulation, first by ligature and then manually to a point where V was unable to breathe, was a particularly serious incident of cruelty.  The level of harm caused by the count 2 offence plainly fell into category 1.  Moreover, as the judge was rightly imposing concurrent sentences, the sentence on count 2 had to reflect the overall seriousness of the offending.  Counts 1 and 3 were by no means minor offences.  Count 1 related to a number of periods when V had been kept off school so that teachers would not see the injuries which the offender had inflicted on her.  Count 3 related to the period of prolonged cruelty in March 2021, when the offender, in addition to failing to seek medical help, was also again keeping V away from school.  As Mr Lloyd submits, had staff at the school had the opportunity to see V and to note the injuries inflicted upon her, it may well be that the prolonged course of cruelty would have come to an end sooner than it did.
24.
Moreover, whilst we recognise the difficulties faced by the offender during lockdown, the judge had to take into account that V herself was particularly vulnerable during that period.  The fact that the offender kept her away from school shows his awareness of the harm he was causing, and his failure to give priority to her needs rather than to his own avoidance of detection.  In those circumstances a significant upwards adjustment of the starting point applicable to count 2 was necessary before consideration of the aggravating and mitigating features.
25.
The offender's previous convictions were a serious aggravating feature.  True it is that none of the convictions for violence was very ; but they included domestic abuse of his former partner, and should have served as a clear warning to him of the need to control his temper when caring for V.  We should add that having responsibility for the child concerned is an essential ingredient of the offence of child cruelty.  Such offences therefore necessarily involve a domestic context which is reflected in the sentencing levels set by the Guideline.
26.
The deliberate concealment of the offending was a further aggravating factor, though we keep in mind that to some extent it overlaps with the counts 1 and 3 offences and it is therefore necessary to take care to avoid double counting.
27.
In those circumstances, we are unable to share the judge's conclusion that the balancing of all relevant features of the case resulted in a final sentence which, before reduction for plea, was less than the guideline starting point for the count 2 offence alone.  In our judgment, even giving as much weight as possible to the personal mitigation, it was unavoidably necessary to come to a final sentence markedly above the starting point for a single offence.  In all the circumstances, we conclude that before reduction for guilty pleas the least total sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the offending as a whole was 8 years' imprisonment.
28.
The Sentencing Council's guideline on Reduction in sentence for a guilty plea makes clear that the maximum reduction of one-third is reserved for cases in which the offender indicates his guilt at the first stage of the proceedings.  This offender did not do so.  He gave no indication at all in the magistrates' court and his pleas were not immediately entered in the Crown Court.  He could not expect a reduction of more than one-quarter.
29.
For those reasons we grant leave to refer, we quash the sentence imposed below on count 2 and substitute for it a sentence of 6 years' imprisonment.  The sentences on counts 1 and 3 remain as before.  Thus the total sentence is now 6 years' imprisonment.

    Exact: The offender himself made admissions as to what he had done.  When challenged by L on 16 March 2021 about the injuries to V which were visible that day, he said that he had ""battered her over a few days"".  He went on to say that V had looked at him in a funny way, so he had “battered” her again; and he had then “battered” her yet again because she had disrespected him by not doing what he told her to do.  The following morning, when further bruising was seen by L, the offender graphically listed what had done: ""I've punched her, I've kicked her, I've kneed her, I've strangled her with a charging wire, I've pushed her, I've bit her"".  He went on to say to L: ""What you don't understand, when I'm in a rage fight mode takes over and it doesn't matter who you are"".  He added: ""Something would normally trigger me to stop but she looked at me funny and I would go back into fight mode"".  Having heard this, L contacted the police.

    Comment: offender making progress to recover from his alcoholism and problems
    Exact: Ms Henshaw submits on behalf of the offender that the sentence was not unduly lenient.  She accepts that count 2 fell into category 1A of the guideline, but submits that factors of medium culpability and harm were also present and that the guideline starting point was therefore properly reduced by the judge.  She submits that the offender had succeeded in making substantial progress in his recovery from alcoholism and in overcoming his past problems, but his mental health relapsed in the circumstances thrust upon him by lockdown and by the lack of support available to him during that difficult period.

    Exact: the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the prolonged course of incidents of serious cruelty, the presence of many high culpability factors relevant to count 2, the aggravating feature of the previous convictions, including previous domestic assaults, and the failure to seek medical treatment charged in count 3.  The combination of those features, he submits, should have resulted in a substantial adjustment above the guideline starting point for count 2, before considering the mitigating factors of remorse, mental health issues and personal mitigation.  Mr Lloyd adds that the offender should not have received full credit for his guilty pleas, which were not indicated at the first opportunity.  He submits that the total sentence was for those reasons unduly lenient.

Mr RS Gioserano
appeared on behalf of the
Appellant
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
J U D G M E N T
1.
MR JUSTICE WYN WILLIAMS: On 22 August 2007, before HHJ Hoffman sitting at the Crown Court at York, the appellant pleaded guilty to an offence of wounding, contrary to
section 20 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861
. On 4 October 2007, the same judge sentenced the appellant to a term of 33 months' imprisonment. The appellant appeals against that sentence with leave of the Single Judge.
2.
The incident giving rise to the proceedings against the Appellant took place in a public house in Harrogate known as the Slip Inn on 12 March 2007. The public house is a small one usually frequented by regular customers. At the material time two such customers were the appellant and a man called Peter Kemp. Both were present in the public house on 12 March together with about five other people. Towards the end of the evening, at about 10pm a person, or more than one person, was in the pub with the appellant and he or they spoke to Mr Kemp. Something occurred to cause the conversation between those men to become heated. The appellant joined in with the conversation and this much is common ground that as the conversation came to an end Mr Kemp called the appellant a ""prick"".
3.
What happened next is the subject of some confusion in the sense that the witness statements taken by the police officers did not all agree about the precise sequence of events and what the appellant did. However, the sentencing judge proceeded on this basis that Mr Kemp turned away from the appellant and began to walk back to the place where he had been having a drink and it was while he had his back turned to the appellant that he was attacked by him. The attack took this form: the appellant struck Mr Kemp at least two blows. He did that while he was holding a glass. The judge found that after the first blow had been struck the glass was broken, so that it followed that the second, and any subsequent blow, was with a broken glass. The blows which were struck with the glass were to the sides of Mr Kemp's head. Those blows caused him to go to the ground. The attack was aggravated by the fact that whilst Mr Kemp was on the ground the appellant kicked him twice.
4.
As a consequence of this attack Mr Kemp suffered distinct lacerations on each side of his head. Fortunately the injuries can properly be regarded as transient, but, in the circumstances, that might easily not have been the case.
5.
Following this incident the appellant was charged not with an offence of wounding, but with wounding with intent. When the indictment was drawn it was wounding with intent which was the offence that was placed upon the indictment. At a preliminary hearing, on 18 May 2007, the appellant indicated that his plea to that offence would be ""not guilty"", but he also indicated a willingness to plead to wounding. At that stage such a plea was not acceptable to the prosecution.
6.
The same stance remained, so far as the prosecution was concerned, when a plea and directions hearing took place on 10 August and accordingly a trial was fixed. However, on the day of the trial the appellant was informed by his counsel, after discussions with the prosecution, that a plea to
section 20
was acceptable to the prosecution and at that stage he entered that plea. Counsel for the appellant submits that this course was not one with which Judge Hoffman concurred. That may be correct. However, it remains the case that the discussions between counsel resulted in the course which was taken and the learned judge did nothing, in the end, to interfere with that course.
7.
Mr Gioserano, counsel for the appellant, makes one essential submission and that is that a sentence of 33 months was too long for this offence. He submits, quite correctly, that the appellant was entitled to full credit for his plea of guilty and that being so he submits that the judge's starting point for his sentence was a sentence after trial in excess of four years. Counsel submits that although this was a serious offence, on any view, it was not such so as to attract a sentence which is quite close to the maximum available.
8.
In making that submission he relies upon two decisions of this court. The first decision which he cites is the case of
Robertson
(1998) 1 C app R (S) 21. The second case is that of
Singleton
(1998) 1 Cr App R (S) 199. In our judgment the case of
Singleton
is one which may not be decided in the same way in the current sentencing climate. Counsel for the applicant conceded as much during the course of this oral application. The case of
Robertson
, however, does contain general views expressed by the court which we need address.
Robertson
involved the glassing of a man in a public house. He was drinking in the public house when he attacked a man by thrusting a beer glass into the left side of his face. The glass broke on impact and caused wounds to the victim's face. Mr Robertson pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two-and-a-half years' imprisonment.
9.
This court reduced the sentence from two-and-a-half years to two years. During the course of giving the judgment of the court, Latham J, as he then was, reviewed a number of authorities dealing with offences of
section 20
and then said this:
""The position in our judgment is that, in the light of those authorities, the Court should look with some care at sentences over two years' imprisonment for an offence under
section 20
to see whether in truth there is a real justification for a sentence of the length in question on the facts of the particular case.""
Then he went on to refer to the personal mitigation available to the appellant in that case. He said:
""...in our judgment the mitigation, namely his plea, his undoubted remorse and the fact that he appears to have taken steps to address his alcohol abuse, do not in our view justify the conclusion that the circumstances of this case necessitate a sentence of more than two years' imprisonment.""
In his sentencing remarks Judge Hoffman distinguished both
Robertson
and
Singleton
on the basis that each of those cases involved one single blow with a glass, whereas in the instant case there were at least two blows with a glass followed by two kicks to the victim while he lay on the floor. In our judgment Judge Hoffman was correct to distinguish those decisions on that basis.
10.
In our view this case on its facts is significantly worse than either
Robertson
or
Singleton
. However, in the light of the more general point made by the Court in
Robertson
we propose to look closely at the issue as to what extent, if any, a sentence in excess of two years is justified in this case.
11.
We begin our scrutiny by asking the question: what is the correct starting point after a trial for sentence for this appellant in relation to this offence? Is it something over four years, as the judge clearly thought, or is that too high? In fixing the appropriate length of course we must consider not just the circumstances of the offence, but also the personal mitigation available to the offender. The appellant is 30 years old, 29 at the time of the offence. He has no relevant previous conviction. Lest that be thought to be doing less than justice to his previous character, we should say that he has one conviction for a minor offence involving a vehicle.
12.
He is hard-working, or at least was until his conviction for this offence, and he is spoken of highly in a number of written references. The pre-sentence report described the risk of his re-offending as low. He has always, as we have indicated, been prepared to plead guilty to
section 20
. In a short report from the prison at which he is serving his sentence it is clear that the appellant is responding well to his incarceration. That, in itself, of course, does not affect the appropriate starting point for sentence directly, but does give some insight into whether expressions of remorse, and the like, are genuinely made.
13.
In our judgment, balancing the serious nature of the assault against the personal mitigation available to the appellant, and for the moment ignoring discount for guilty plea, we consider that the appropriate sentence after a trial would have been of the order of about three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Taking that as our starting point, we think that the appropriate sentence in this case, after giving credit for the guilty plea, would have been one of 27 months.
14.
We propose to quash the sentence of 33 months imprisonment and substitute one of 27 months. To that extent, this appeal is allowed.
15.

    Exact: a sentence of 33 months was too long for this offence. He submits, quite correctly, that the appellant was entitled to full credit for his plea of guilty and that being so he submits that the judge's starting point for his sentence was a sentence after trial in excess of four years. Counsel submits that although this was a serious offence, on any view, it was not such so as to attract a sentence which is quite close to the maximum available.

LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE:
1.
On 10
th
January 2023, in the Crown Court at Leicester, His Honour Judge Mooncey sentenced the two appellants, and more than 20 other men, for their respective roles in a large-scale drugs conspiracy.  The appellant Matthew Wharlow had pleaded guilty on 23
rd
June 2022 to conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of Class A, namely cocaine.  He was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, which was ordered to run consecutively to a sentence which he was already serving.  The appellant Toby Poole had pleaded guilty on 8
th
June 2021 to the same offence.  He was sentenced to six years and eight months' imprisonment.
2.
Each appellant now appeals against his sentence with the leave of the single judge.
3.
Purely for convenience, and intending no disrespect, we shall refer to the appellants and others by their surnames only.
4.
The broad facts of the case can be briefly summarised.  The conspiracy period charged in the indictment ran from 1
st
March 2020 to 22
nd
September 2020.  A group based in Leicester, some of whom used EncroChat devices, bought very large quantities of cocaine and sold it to other cocaine dealers.  Those at the head of the group, including Julien, were responsible for buying and selling the cocaine, including the purchase of 20 kilograms of the drug in one transaction alone.  Other co-conspirators arranged for the storage and distribution of the cocaine.  Customers of the group, including McLeary, Arkate and Raja, were supplied by, and made payment to, nominated conspirators.  The appellant Wharlow, and a co-conspirator Lees-Rowe, were couriers for McLeary.  The appellant Poole was a courier for Arkate and Raja.
5.
Wharlow pleaded guilty on the basis that he acted as a courier for Lees-Rowe on an occasion in April 2020, when Lees-Rowe arranged for him to travel to Leicester, collect one kilogram of cocaine from Julien, and convey the drugs to McLeary in Nottinghamshire.
6.
In September 2021, Wharlow had pleaded guilty in the Crown Court at Harrow to offences of conspiracy relating to the importation and supply of cocaine, and money laundering of the proceeds of selling it, between March and June 2020.  He accepted that he had acted as a courier for Lees-Rowe on a number of occasions, and had received payment for each trip.  In all, he was involved in delivering drugs and collecting money on five occasions.  The total weight of the cocaine involved was 78 kilograms.  He asserted, but the prosecution did not accept, that he had not initially been aware of what he was delivering and that when he became aware he did not know the precise quantities.
7.
On 14
th
March 2022, again in the Crown Court at Harrow, Wharlow was sentenced to concurrent terms totalling ten years and nine months' imprisonment.  That total term reflected a sentence for the importation offence of 12 years, before a reduction for his guilty plea on the day of trial.  The concurrent sentence for the conspiracy to supply cocaine was nine years and six months' imprisonment.  We note that under the relevant sentencing guideline, the term of 12 years represents the bottom of the category range for a ""leading role"" and the top of the category range for a ""significant role"" in a category 1 substantive offence of supplying a controlled drug.
8.
We understand that an application was made to transfer the Harrow proceedings to Leicester so that all matters against Wharlow – and indeed Lees-Rowe – could be dealt with by one court at the same time.  That application was unsuccessful for reasons of practicality relating to the numbers of different co-defendants in the two sets of proceedings.
9.
The appellant Poole pleaded guilty on the basis that he made three trips, for which he was paid by Raja.  He travelled to Leicester, Toddington and London.  He delivered one kilogram of cocaine on one occasion, delivered half a kilogram on another occasion, and collected cash on the third occasion.  He accepted that he had also supplied smaller quantities of cocaine for Raja on two other occasions, so that in total he was directly involved in the delivery of more than 1.5 kilograms of the drug.  It was admitted that on each occasion when he acted as a courier, he was given Raja's EncroChat device, which he returned after completing his journey.  He asserted, but the prosecution did not accept, that he had no awareness of the wider conspiracy.
10.
At the sentencing hearing, there was no pre-sentence report in relation to either of the appellants.  None was thought necessary then, and we are satisfied that none is necessary now.
11.
Wharlow is now aged 32.  Before his involvement in the two drugs conspiracies, he had no recent or relevant previous convictions.
12.
Poole is now aged 45.  His previous convictions included one in 2012 for an offence of producing cannabis, which the judge regarded as significant when sentencing for this offence.
13.
Neither appellant had previously received any custodial sentence.
14.
In his sentencing remarks, the judge said that Wharlow had connections with persons near the top of the conspiracy and had played a significant role.  He took the view that if this offence had stood alone, it would have merited a sentence in the region of eight years' imprisonment.  If, however, it had been dealt with at the same time as the other offences in the Crown Court at Harrow, it would have increased the total sentence by about a year.  Giving credit for the guilty plea to the present offence, the judge concluded that the appropriate sentence was one of ten months' imprisonment, which he ordered to run consecutively to the sentence already being served.
15.
The judge found that Poole had also played a significant role.  He had used an EncroChat device, and by travelling to Toddington and London, had an awareness of the national reach of the conspiracy.  The judge took a sentence after trial of eight years and six months.  Giving credit of 20 per cent for the guilty plea, he imposed the sentence of six years and eight months' imprisonment.
16.
Wharlow appeals on the ground that the judge fell into error in his application of the Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on totality.  Mr Schofield, on his behalf, relies on the fact that in the Harrow proceedings Wharlow had been sentenced for his actions in relation to 78 kilograms of cocaine.  He submits that if all matters had been dealt with together, the overall sentence would not have been increased because Wharlow was involved in the movement of a further one kilogram of the drug.  He argues, accordingly, that the judge should have ordered the sentence to run concurrently with the existing sentence, and not consecutively to it.
17.
We see force in that submission.  It is unfortunate that all of Wharlow's offending was not dealt with at the same time, though we understand the reasons why it was not.  The judge in the present case had a very difficult task in sentencing so many defendants; and the fact that Wharlow was already serving a substantial sentence was an additional complication.  We remind ourselves, however, that the overriding principle of totality, as stated in the guideline, is that the overall sentence should reflect all of the offending behaviour, together with the aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the offences and those personal to the offender, and be just and proportionate.  If all matters had been before the court at the same time, this particular movement of one kilogram of cocaine would have been the third in a sequence of six occasions, all involving very similar conduct by this appellant within a short period of time.  Having regard to the very much greater quantities of cocaine moved by Wharlow on the other occasions, and to the fact that the lead offence in his sentencing at Harrow was the importation offence, we accept the submission that the sentence already being served provided just and proportionate punishment for all the offending.  We note the judge’s indication that if all matters had been dealt with together, there would have been a concurrent sentence for this offence of about seven years' imprisonment.  We shall not, however, alter the judge's decision as to the length of the sentence, in order to avoid any possible argument about the effect in these circumstances of
section 11(3)
of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
.
18.
We therefore allow Wharlow's appeal to this extent: we quash the sentence of ten months' imprisonment which was ordered to run consecutively to the sentence already being served, and substitute for it a sentence of ten months' imprisonment which will run concurrently with that already being served.
19.
We turn to the appeal of Poole.  He challenges the judge's categorisation of his involvement in the offending as a significant role.  Mr Canning, on Poole's behalf, submits that under the relevant definitive guideline Poole should have been found to have played a lesser role, not a significant one.  He accepts that it was category 2 offending, but notes that the lesser role, which he contends was appropriate, has a starting point of five years' custody and a range of three years six months to seven years; whereas the significant role found by the judge has a starting point of eight years' custody, and a range from six years six months to ten years.
20.
By reference to the guideline, Mr Canning submits that four of the characteristics of a lesser role were present: performing a limited function under direction; no influence on those above in the chain; very little, if any, awareness or understanding of the scale of the operation; and expectation of limited, if any, gain.  Mr Canning questions whether any of the characteristics of a significant role was present.  He accordingly submits that the judge should have taken the starting point appropriate to a lesser role.
21.
The judge was fully apprised of all the circumstances of the case and was in the best position to assess the comparative roles and culpability of the many conspirators.  In our view, he was entitled to find that Poole played a significant role.  Focusing on the two key points highlighted by the judge in his sentencing remarks, neither the use of the EncroChat device, nor the travelling of appreciable distances to different parts of the country, can be said to reflect a limited function under direction and a lack of awareness of the scale of the operation.  They are more consistent with the performing of an operational function within a chain, and with some awareness and understanding of the scale of the operation.  We regard the use of the EncroChat device as particularly significant, notwithstanding that it was only loaned to Poole for use during each trip: quite apart from the financial cost to Raja of that device, it would only be entrusted to someone who could be relied upon to keep it secure and to avoid any revelation, whether to the police or to rival drug dealers, of its ""handle"", or of the information it contained.  It would, moreover, serve as a clear indication to the person to whom it was temporarily provided that the person in full control of it was operating at a serious level of criminal activity.  As a discrete further point, we are not persuaded by the submission that the sums received by Poole amounted to no more than a modest financial gain.
22.
We are therefore unable to accept the submission that the judge mischaracterised Poole's role.  Mr Canning realistically accepts that if the categorisation was not incorrect, there can be no successful criticism of the judge's decisions as to the appropriate sentence after trial and as to the appropriate credit for the guilty plea.
23.
For those reasons, Poole's appeal fails and is dismissed.

appeared on behalf of the
Appellant

J U D G M E N T
1.
THE RECORDER: On 11th February 2009, at the Crown Court at Ipswich, the appellant pleaded guilty to one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 12th March 2009 he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Thompson to an extended sentence of four years, comprising a custodial term of two years' imprisonment and an extension period of two years. He appeals against sentence by leave of the single judge.
2.
The appellant and Natalie Hunt had been in a relationship for just over a year. They had separated some time before the offence took place. The relationship had soured as a result, she said, of the appellant's controlling behaviour and his spiteful, unpredictable and at times violent behaviour towards her.
3.
On the evening of 26th September 2008, Miss Hunt had some girlfriends round to her house for a party. Later she went out and went round a number of public houses in Lowestoft. On two occasions she bumped into the appellant. On one of those occasions he tried to persuade her to rekindle their relationship. She told him in very clear terms that that was not going to happen. He then suddenly turned on her and punched her once to the face using his clenched first. She fell to the floor on her front. He simply walked away as she lay on the ground.
4.
As a result of the punch and the subsequent fall Miss Hunt had injuries to her face. She required dental work, mainly to two chipped front teeth. Initially they were dealt with by way of fillings, but they became painful and infected and required root canal work shortly afterwards. There was a doubtful prognosis and she may lose those teeth altogether.
5.
When interviewed, the appellant was in essence saying that the injury had been caused as a result of an accident. He said it was nothing to do with an assault by him.
6.
In her victim impact statement, dated 7th October, Miss Hunt said that she had been working with vulnerable 13 to 17 year olds when the injuries happened and she had been very concerned about them seeing her facial injuries due to their own life experiences. Further, she started to have problems with chest pains and bruising which she thought had been a consequence of the force with which she fell to the pavement.
7.
The appellant was born on 20th July 1979 and was therefore 30 years of age. He has nine previous convictions for ten offences. They include two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, two offences of threatening behaviour, common assault and an affray. He also has two cautions, including one for section 20 wounding and one for an offence of threatening behaviour.
8.
There was a pre-sentence report before the sentencing judge dated 6th March 2009. In it doubt was expressed as to whether the defendant had a realistic perception of the physical and emotional damage he had caused to the complainant. There was, it was said, a medium risk of re-offending. Notice was taken of the fact that he had been to prison three times for offences of violence, one of those had been against a previous partner in similar circumstances to the index offence. There was a pattern of alcohol-related domestic violence underpinned by sexual jealousy. Reference was also made to his high level of alcohol consumption at the weekends.
9.
Grounds of appeal drafted by counsel do not criticise the imposition of an extended sentence and wrongly state that the sentence was lawful. In fact, the sentence was unlawful. By
section 227(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
the court may impose on the offender an extended sentence of imprisonment if the conditions of subsection (2A) or the conditions of subsection (2B) are met. Subsection (2A) states:
""(2A) The condition in this subsection is that, at the time the offence was committed, the offender had been convicted of an offence specified in Schedule 15A.""
Subsection (2B) states:
""(2B) The condition in this subsection is that, if the court were to impose an extended sentence of imprisonment, the term that it would specify as the appropriate custodial term would be at least four years.""
10.
As the learned judge was clearly of the view that a custodial term of four years would not be justified and as the appellant had not been previously convicted of an offence specified on Schedule 15A of the Criminal Justice Act, then the only custodial option to the court was a standard commensurate determinate sentence. In such circumstances this court has no option but to allow the appeal so far as the extension period is concerned.
11.
The situation concerning the extended sentence was the only ground upon which leave to appeal was granted by the single judge, the error being first picked up by the single judge. In his grounds of appeal counsel also criticised the length of the custodial term. As we have said, leave was not granted to appeal that part of the sentence. Mr O'Donnell, appearing for the appellant, has renewed his application to raise that point and we have heard him. In essence, his complaint is that too much emphasis was placed on the previous convictions of the appellant.
12.
This is the second time this morning that mention has been made of judges taking too much account of previous convictions. It is worth remembering that
section 143(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
states:
""In considering the seriousness of an offence committed by an offender who has one or more previous convictions, the court must treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor if (in the case of that conviction) the court considers that it can reasonably be so treated having regard, in particular, to -
(a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence, and
(b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction.""
13.
We think that the learned judge in the circumstances of this case was quite right to give considerable weight to this appellant's previous convictions. In our judgment, this was a nasty attack by a man prone to violence. The sentence was not wrong in principle and in view of his previous convictions it was not manifestly excessive. Therefore the appeal is allowed only to the limited extent that we have mentioned already, as we have said, relating to the extension period.","citation:

These defendants were all convicted, after trial, of murder. Their appeals challenge the minimum term which the judge attached to the mandatory life sentence which each received.
2.
We take the facts essentially from the concise summary given by the judge in the course of conspicuously careful sentencing remarks.
3.
The defendant Lee Griffiths is the father of the defendants Thomas and Luke Griffiths and the stepfather of Mark Jackson. Lee and others were concerned in a commercial operation for the supply of drugs, chiefly heroin. The operation was centred on a bungalow in Grimsby. It bought, and sold on, about half a kilogram of heroin every seven to ten days. The purchase price was £10,000 or more each time. Retail sales were made both from the bungalow and via a number of street sellers. Lee was the mastermind and leader of this team of drug dealers. His son Thomas was a trusted secondary participant. One of the minions used as a driver and a street seller was the deceased, Adam Vincent. Vincent was himself an addict and in very bad health as a result. He was in hospital for two weeks at the end of January 2011 but discharged himself against advice and returned, despite a parlous state of health, to the trade. Lee Griffiths became convinced in February 2011 that Vincent had betrayed the gang, either by stealing some thousands of pounds, or by doctoring the drugs, or by informing on the others. That conviction of Lee’s was connected in his mind to the arrest of Lee, Thomas and a driver (Frow) on 11 February, when they were stopped in a car containing drugs. It was also fuelled by Lee’s own use of drugs, including crack cocaine. In consequence of Lee’s belief, arrangements were made by the four defendants to apprehend, beat and interrogate Vincent. Serious violence was inflicted on him over a period of between one week and two, culminating in his death on Monday 28
th
February in the hands of the gang, still being tortured. He was freed from time to time, and seen to be bearing injuries. This period was not the first time he had been injured; when in hospital in January he was seen to have air pellets lodged in his chest and neck. Within the period leading up to his death, one occasion was spoken of by a gang member who gave Queen’s evidence: Lee had interrogated Vincent with a knife to his neck, Thomas had punched him in the face, and Luke had kicked him hard to his side. Vincent was in such fear that he lost control of his bowels. By the time he died, Vincent had damage to his spleen and multiple broken ribs, probably attributable to stamping, and had been struck at least three times to the head by some weapon such as an axe, a hatchet or a golf club; these last blows were the immediate cause of death. Having killed him, the defendants dismembered his body crudely but effectively with a hacksaw, dividing it into six parts. Those parts were then disposed of in separate watercourses during the night of 2/3 March, and using a vehicle which had been acquired specifically for the purpose. Some of the clothing of the deceased, and some pieces of bone, were burned at a remote location in the early morning of 3 March, and other potentially incriminating material was burned in a bonfire at the bungalow. Friends of the defendants who had some knowledge of Vincent being in the hands of the gang were told peremptorily to keep their silence.
4.
All four defendants were convicted by the jury of murder. All were also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by dismembering and disposing of the body. Lee and Thomas were convicted of conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Jackson was acquitted of the drugs offence, and the jury failed to agree as to Luke on that count, and was discharged from reaching a verdict.
5.
Lee Griffiths was 42 at the time of the murder. He had some twenty two previous convictions, chiefly for dishonesty and vehicle offences. There was no prior conviction for violence except one public order offence, although he was found in possession of pepper spray in 1999.
6.
Luke, his younger son, was 19 at the time of the murder. He had no previous conviction or caution.
7.
Thomas was 21 at the time of the murder. He had no previous conviction but had sustained a reprimand for assault in 2005. Reports showed that his behaviour had been troublesome from his childhood, during which he had also been bullied. He had a low IQ, assessed as mild learning difficulties and some signs of paranoid, aggressive and anti-social personality disorder.
8.
Mark Jackson was 26 at the time of the murder. He had previous convictions since the age of 16, which included disorder and violence. He had served sentences of 6 months for affray, and of 18 months (twice) for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wounding. There were also offences of dishonesty.
9.
The judge approached the fixing of minimum terms with considerable care. He applied himself directly to sections 269 and 270 and to Schedule 21 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
. He correctly reminded himself that the Schedule was not to be applied mechanically but that sentences reflecting the true criminality involved were to be passed. He was, however, required by section 270 to state which of the starting points set out in Schedule 21 he adopted, and did so as 30 years.
10.
The Crown had submitted that this case fell directly within paragraph 5(2)(c) of the Schedule, namely that it was murder done for gain. It contended that the murder was done in aid of preserving the profitable illegal trade in drugs. It was not contended that any other of the examples of particularly serious conduct contained in paragraph 5(2) applied. In particular, this was not said to be a murder involving sadistic conduct; the violence, though sustained and considerable, had not been done for pleasure.
11.
The judge did not hold this to be within the terms of paragraph 5(2)(c), ie a murder done for gain. He reminded himself, correctly, that the cases itemised in paragraph 5(2) are simply examples of what the court will normally hold to be murders of which the seriousness is “particularly high”, and that the list is in no sense exhaustive. What he then said was this:
“In my judgment a murder in perceived protection and enforcement of the interests of a commercial drugs supply business, even if not precisely a killing for gain, is very closely analogous to it. There can be no sensible distinction in seriousness, in my judgment, between such a murder and a murder committed in the course of a robbery of burglary, two of the specific examples given in the statute…
….the fatal attack was motivated by the perceived need to extract retribution on Mr Vincent for having damaged the gang’s interest and to enforce a primitive discipline within the gang.”
12.
The judge then identified aggravating factors in:
i)
the vulnerability of the victim;
ii)
the physical suffering inflicted on him prior to his death; and
iii)
the dismemberment and disposal of the body.
13.
The judge also identified mitigating factors. In the case of the younger defendants, their age was such. For all defendants, he expressly found that he was prepared to proceed on the basis that there had not been an intention to kill, but rather an intention to do grievous harm, and death had resulted. For much the same reason he rejected significant premeditation as an additional aggravating factor.
14.
The judge held that the synthesis of those factors took the sentence up from the starting point of 30 years to 35. In so concluding, he made no further addition for the count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, plainly because that had been treated as a factor aggravating the sentence already and to do so would be to count it twice. He observed that, had it stood alone, it would have justified a sentence of about 8 years (thus the equivalent of a minimum term of 4 years). Nor did he add to the sentences, in the cases of Lee or Thomas, for the count of conspiracy to supply drugs, taking the view that it was already reflected in the long minimum terms which were arrived at after considering the background of drug dealing. He did observe that if it had stood alone that count would have called for sentences of not less than 12 years for Lee and 9 years for Thomas.
15.
We entirely agree with the judge’s self direction that Schedule 21 cannot be applied mechanically, and that paragraph 5(2) is in no sense an exhaustive list of the kinds of case which a court may determine to be of particularly high seriousness. This court has said so on too many occasions to list. A mechanical application of the Schedule is apt to create absurd anomalies, such as that corrected in
R v Height & Anderson
[2008] EWCA Crim 2500
; [2009] 1 Cr App R(S) 676, where a simplistic application of the schedule would have resulted in the paid contract killer being subject to a starting point double that of the employer who incited and engaged him and for whose purposes the killing was carried out. Nor can the Schedule be applied in an arithmetical manner, by adding or subtracting years attributable to separate features of the case: that was demonstrated to be unworkable in
R v Peters and others
[2005] EWCA Crim 605
; [2005 2 Cr App R (S) 101 at 627; see paragraph [8]. As was observed in
R v Jones
[2005] EWCA Crim 3414
; [2006] 2 CR App R(S) 18 at 117, the very large gaps between the starting points identified in the Schedule present a sentencer with considerable difficulties in his quest to match the penalty to the infinitely variable circumstances of crime. It is nonetheless clear that it was not Parliament’s intention that the Schedule should be applied mechanically by fitting each case into the nearest available starting point and making only minor adjustments to it. That is clear from paragraph 9 of the Schedule, which says:
“Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point)….”
16.
The principal challenge mounted here to the judge’s sentence involves the contention that this was not a murder for gain. However, as we have pointed out, the judge did not say that it was, and it was quite unnecessary to force the case into the straitjacket of paragraph 5(2)(c) in order to arrive at the conclusion that the right starting point was 30 years. What the judge did conclude was that this was a murder committed in pursuit of a large-scale and very serious criminal enterprise and for the purposes of enforcement of loyalty or of primitive discipline. The question raised by this appeal is this: where on the scale of murders does this situation lie? Was the judge entitled to treat it as of a seriousness comparable to the examples listed in paragraph 5(2) or was he not?
17.
Mr Barnes QC, for Thomas Griffiths, submitted to us that because paragraph 5 is concerned with murders of especial gravity it would be wrong for the court to go outside its express terms and, in effect, extend the concept of a murder done for gain. That is tantamount to a submission that the examples given in the paragraph are exhaustive, which is an argument which Mr Barnes correctly disclaimed, and we reject it. Nor can we accept his argument that a murder can only be done for gain if the gain or potential gain is identified. The point does not arise because the judge did not treat this as murder for gain, but in any event, although no doubt it will often be possible to identify the gain, there can clearly be cases where gain is the purpose but the mechanism and amount are obscure. Mr Barnes further submitted that the judge’s findings in this case amounted to no more than a motive of revenge for supposed misbehaviour on the part of the deceased, and that that does not bring a case within paragraph 5(2). We agree that revenge is a frequent motive for murder and that by itself it will not ordinarily make the offence of particularly high seriousness if otherwise it would not be. But the converse is also true. If the offence is of particularly high seriousness properly comparable with the examples set out in paragraph 5(2), the fact that revenge is a component will not save it from the heightened starting point. This was not, on the judge’s findings, comparable to the case identified by Mr Barnes of revenge against a cheating spouse. This was torture, and eventually murder, in the furtherance of a serious criminal enterprise, to keep the enterprise intact and to discipline its members. There was ample evidence of threats to others as well as to the deceased. The fact that prolonged interrogation was going on is a further indication of this purpose.
18.
We conclude that the judge was entitled to hold that this murder, bearing these characteristics, was comparable with the examples given in paragraph 5(2). Some of those might, in particular circumstances, be less serious, as for example the owner of a lawfully held shotgun who, in the course of a drunken argument with a friend, uses the gun on him. We are not to be taken as holding that all murders committed in the course of criminal enterprises will be of particularly high seriousness – it will depend on the scale of the enterprise and the circumstances of the killing, and it is clear that some will not be at all suitable for a 30 year starting point. But the combination here of the pursuit of large-scale drug dealing, with enforcement of criminal discipline, and with sustained torture sufficiently justify the conclusion arrived at by the judge. The incidence of potential gain, in the sense that the drugs business was no doubt very profitable, is not the determining factor. The position could easily be the same if a similar killing were carried out to enforce discipline in one’s followers in a different form of criminal enterprise which was not principally acquisitive, such as gang warfare or the sexual exploitation of minors.
19.
After thought, the judge adopted the same starting point for each defendant. In our view he was right, on the facts of this case, to do so. He did not, in doing so, forget that the defendants Luke Griffiths and Mark Jackson had not been convicted of the drug conspiracy, a matter which is of some significance and to which we will return. Since all the defendants were equally involved in the killing, and since the killing was very plainly for the purpose of preserving the criminal enterprise intact and of disciplining its minor members, all were equally affected by its characteristics. We are unable to agree with the submission, made for Luke by Mr Harbage QC, that the proper inference is that he was acting from no more purpose than to obey a dominant father. We do not doubt that father was dominant, nor that Luke was influenced greatly by him, and this is of relevance later in the exercise. But he very clearly knew what the background and purpose of the torture and murder was and he was fully involved in it.
20.
Limited challenge has been mounted to the judge’s identification of aggravating factors. We agree that the victim was vulnerable in the sense that he was ill and dependent on drugs. We also agree with the submissions made on behalf of the defendants that these conditions were self inflicted. Perhaps more significantly, we are quite satisfied that the subservience of the deceased, which was part of his vulnerability, is already factored into the sentencing process because it was part of the enforcement/punishment characteristic of the offence.
21.
We have no doubt that we should reject the contention that the sustained ill-treatment of the deceased was irrelevant as mere historical background or separate but similar prior conduct. It may be that in other cases prior similar misconduct would not be sufficiently connected to the killing to be relevant to the adoption of the starting point, but in this case there was the clearest evidence of a single course of conduct involving repeated “interrogation” and serious violence, culminating in injuries to which the deceased succumbed. It was all part of the murder. However, as with the vulnerability of the victim, we take the view that this factor has already been part of the calculation of the correct starting point and ought not to result in a further increase beyond it.
22.
No one has contended that the callous dismemberment and disposal of the body do not aggravate the offence and justify an increase in the minimum term. We agree.
23.
The principal mitigating or reducing factor in this case, affecting all defendants, is the absence of an intention to kill. We agree that in a case of sustained violence in pursuit of an intention to cause grievous harm, this is of less force than it might be in cases of sudden spontaneous attack, but it is still necessary to recognise the difference between this case and a similar one of gang enforcement in which there was a deliberate execution. Such cases are, unhappily, by no means unknown, and we are sure that they are yet more serious than the present case.
24.
The objective in applying Schedule 21 is to do substantial justice by fitting the punishment, so far as can be done, to the individual features of the case, whilst remaining loyal to the general framework of the schedule. We have reached the clear conclusion that in this case the aggravating factor constituted by the disposal of the body and the mitigating factor of the absence of intended killing in broad terms balance each other. The judge, having said that he arrived at 35 years, imposed a minimum term of 32 years on Lee Griffiths. That meant that he added more than he subtracted. We are persuaded that in his extremely careful sentencing the judge somewhat undervalued the force of the absence of intent, and to the extent that he added for the vulnerability of the victim and/or the sustained torture did not entirely eliminate an element of double counting.
25.
Lee was one of two defendants convicted of the substantial drugs conspiracy. We have no doubt that the judge was right to say that in his case the sentence for that, had it stood alone, would not have been less than 12 years. In point of fact, like the judge, we think it should have been longer and we have no doubt that the two cases cited to him involving sentences of about 12 years after trial were ones of lesser scale than the present; neither involved as much heroin as this one. The drugs alone would have called for a sentence of about 14 years, or the equivalent of a minimum term of 7. We do not agree that the drug dealing has already been factored into the sentence; what has been factored in is the fact that the killing was in pursuit of the criminal enterprise and for the purpose of discipline and enforcement against minor operatives. The
antecedent drug
dealing remains. But we do agree that once one is dealing with a minimum term as long as 30 years, the equivalent of a determinate sentence of 60 years, which no court would ever impose, the general principle of totality leads to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to add further to it for the drugs supply itself.
26.
Accordingly we arrive at 30, not at 35 years, and we remain there for Lee Griffiths, rather than the judge’s figure of 32.
27.
The remaining consideration concerns the relative positions of the several defendants. The judge made adjustments for the ages of the younger defendants and for the absence of any relevant previous conviction in the cases of both Luke and Thomas Griffiths. Having done so, he imposed minimum terms as follows: 29 years for Jackson, 27 year for Thomas Griffiths and 26 years for Luke Griffiths.
28.
It is important to stand back and view the sentences together. It is abundantly clear that Lee was the dominant member of this group and that the impetus for the treatment of the deceased came from him. All the other defendants were either his sons or his stepson; they were for that reason particularly under his influence. Moreover he was, on the judge’s finding, clearly at times irrationally dominant, probably in part because of the intake of crack cocaine. Further, the defendants Luke Griffiths and Jackson are entitled to say that, because they were not convicted of the drugs offence, there ought to be some recognition of that fact in the relative standing of their sentences to that of Lee. Thomas Griffiths cannot say this. Next, as the judge recognised, both Luke Griffiths and Thomas Griffiths have no relevant previous convictions. The same cannot be said of Mark Jackson, who has a significant history of violence. Lastly, there must, as the judge held, be adjustment in recognition of the ages of those two defendants, 19 and 21 respectively, especially in the case of Luke Griffiths,who was only 19. We agree that a sentence of a minimum term of 26 years on a man of 19 is a very severe sentence.
29.
Adjusting for these various factors and checking the outcome by standing back to view the overall picture, we conclude that the minimum terms ought to be as follows: for Jackson and for Thomas Griffiths, for the different reasons we have identified, 25 years, whilst for Luke the term should be 23 years.
30.
We have tested our conclusions by asking ourselves what would have been the outcome if the right starting point had been 15 years. In that event, the first adjustment would have had to be a considerable uplift for the fact that the offence was committed in aid of a major criminal enterprise and to enforce discipline within it. That would have led us to a term of about 25 years. There would then have had to be a significant adjustment upwards for the drugs offence itself in the cases of Lee Griffiths and Jackson, and there would have been a further upward adjustment in all cases for the dismemberment and disposal of the body. There would have been a reduction for the absence of intent to kill and the necessary adjustments to achieve a fair relative balance between the defendants. The result would not have been very different from the one at which we have arrived by the different route, and indeed would not have been even if, contrary to our view, the criminal enforcement aspect of the case only took the minimum term up to somewhere between 20 and 25 years. That this should be so is not surprising, still less unfair. As paragraph 9 of Schedule 21 makes clear, the eventual sentence may be of any length, whatever the starting point. Its length depends, in the end, on the overall circumstances of the case.
31.
For the foregoing reasons, these appeals against sentence are allowed to the limited extent that we substitute minimum terms as follows:
Lee Griffiths:
30 years
Luke Griffiths:
23 years
Thomas Griffiths:
25 years
Mark Jackson:
25 years.","citation:

Judgment
Lord Justice Fulford :
1.
This case relates to an extremely grave conspiracy, based in Liverpool, to supply heroin and cocaine to organised criminal gangs in Scotland, South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire. In all, 13 members of the conspiracy were charged and during the course of the proceedings they either pleaded guilty or were convicted by a jury of a single count of conspiracy to supply a Class A drug. Eight of the conspirators have renewed their applications for leave to appeal their sentences following the refusal of the single judge.
2.
The procedural history relating to the applicants presently before this court can be shortly described. On 12
th
March 2012 at the Crown Court in Liverpool John Cooke, James Swarez, Paul McDonald, Jonathan Cromwell, David Jolly and John Wildman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of Class A.
3.
On 11
th
June 2012 and on the 6 July 2012 at the same court the applicants James Richard Beck and Gordon Smith, were respectively convicted of conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of Class A.
4.
On 8
th
August 2012 the eight applicants were sentenced by Judge Aubrey Q.C., who had presided over all these proceedings, as follows: Cooke and Swarez 17 years’ imprisonment; McDonald 15 years’ imprisonment; Beck 13 years’ imprisonment; Cromwell, Jolly and Smith 12 years’ imprisonment and Wildman 9 years 4 months’ imprisonment.
5.
The judge sentenced the applicants’ co-accused to the following terms of imprisonment: Edward McCreadie 12 years 8 months, David Law 10 years 8 month, Roseanne McCreadie 9 years, Brian Harrison 6 years 8 months and John Earley 6 years. These five defendants either did not appeal their sentences or have not renewed applications for leave to appeal following refusal by the single judge.
6.
The conspiracy lasted between May and November 2011. It involved very large-scale supply and distribution of heroin and cocaine, and the operation was highly sophisticated, efficient and profitable. The headquarters were in Liverpool, and, as we observed above, the drugs were provided to criminal gangs in Scotland, South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire. As the judge stressed, the objective was “to flood the streets, the pubs and clubs in many corners of the country with Class A controlled drugs” and the strategy involved a complete disregard of the impact of this criminality on our society. The judge highlighted the extent to which drugs wreck lives, causing misery and desperation, and they often lead those who are addicted to commit crimes in order to fund their dependency.
7.
There were eight seizures of drugs between July and November at diverse locations, including Glasgow, Crosby, Ross-on-Wye, Cardiff and Blackpool. Some of the drugs were of very high purity, revealing close proximity to the source in that it is to be inferred that the consignments had just arrived in this country. In all some 17 kilos of heroin were intercepted, but this represented only a proportion of the overall amounts involved in the conspiracy, as demonstrated by the movements of some of the defendants. The repeat journeys of the couriers – 54 relevant trips have been identified – put beyond doubt the scale of this operation. On the basis that on average two kilograms were transported on each occasion there was a delivery, and that the purpose of the trips was alternately to deliver drugs and collect money, this criminal enterprise involved in the order of 54 kilograms of drugs. However, there is evidence that drugs were delivered and monies were collected at the same time, and therefore the applicants have been dealt with on the basis of a lenient assessment, indeed the one most favourable to them. In any event, this offending represents at least 20 kilograms at 100% pure heroin and the wholesale value of the drugs was somewhere between £1,775,000 and £3,555,000. As the judge determined, this was drug dealing on an extensive commercial scale, albeit not on a massive scale.
8.
Although the judge decided that the definitive guideline did not apply because the defendants were due to be sentenced for a conspiracy and the amounts involved in this case far exceeded the quantities addressed in the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline, where appropriate he assessed culpability by reference to the approach set out by the Council for drug offences. We note that authority has subsequently clarified that the guideline covers conspiracy offences (see
R v Khan
[2013] EWCA Crim 800
;
[2014] 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 10
, p. 42 at [23]). It is necessary to emphasise that in determining the category of harm, the guideline’s highest category (category 1) identifies an indicative quantity of 5 kilograms of heroin or cocaine for the purposes of identifying the starting point. In the accompanying narrative it is observed “
where the operation is on the most serious and commercial scale, involving a quantity of drugs significantly higher than category 1, sentences of 20 years and above may be appropriate, depending on the role of the offender
”. Historically, the decisions of this court have revealed that sentences in excess of 20 years are justified in cases involving very large quantities of cocaine and heroin (see
Morris
[2009] EWCA Crim 32
;
Attorney Generals References 99 – 102
[2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 82, p. 505 and
Attorney General’s References 15 – 17 of 2012
[2012] EWCA Crim 1414
;
[2013] 1 Cr App R (S) 52
, p. 289).
9.
The judge found that in addition to the highly significant quantities involved, there were a number of other factors to which we will turn when considering the individual cases of these applicants. He determined that a significant number of the defendants fell to be sentenced on the basis that they had played a leading role. In this context, the judge referred to the judgments of this court in
Attorney General’s References 15 – 17 of 2012 (supra)
and
R v. Boakye and others
[2012] EWCA Crim 838
;
[2013] 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 2
, p. 6 in which it was noted that couriers who are aware of the harm they are inflicting and who have nonetheless chosen to participate will be assessed as having played a leading or a significant role, depending on the circumstances.
10.
The judge found that the organisers included Cooke and Swarez, and that as a result they played leading roles. He decided that Cromwell and Beck had “
extremely significant roles
” as major drug dealers in their own right, McDonald had a leading role and that all the other defendants played significant roles, by acting as couriers, providing safe houses or acting as a conduit or go-between, given particularly that without their contribution “the aim and goal of this conspiracy could not succeed”.
11.
We turn now to the individual applicants.
12.
John Vincent Cooke
is 33 years of age. He was sentenced to 17 years’ imprisonment (the starting point was 23 years’ imprisonment). He has no relevant previous offences in that his only convictions relating to drugs in 2002 and 2007 concerned possession of cocaine. He was described by the judge as being at the heart of the business, which he controlled, directed and organised. He had been present at significant meetings and an analysis of the telephone traffic revealed his involvement and close communication with his co-conspirators. The judge noted particularly that when 3 kilograms were seized on 1 September in the possession of Cooke’s courier in Crosby, it reflected “
off the boat purity
”. The judge was certain that this applicant was simply concerned to make as much money as possible. Indeed, the author of the pre-sentence report dated 23
rd
March 2012 reported that Cooke had indicated that he had willingly entered the business of selling drugs and understood the effects of the drugs trade. It was recognised that he was involved in the drugs trade at a higher level than “
street dealer
”.
13.
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly given the key role he played in this offending, he was assessed as posing a low risk of re-offending. His attitude in prison has been commendable, both in terms of addressing his consumption of drugs and his general behaviour.
14.
His counsel advances two principles submissions in support of the general proposition that the sentence was manifestly excessive: first that the judge adopted too high a starting point in all the circumstances of the case, and, second, he failed to give sufficient discount for his early guilty plea (he had told the prosecution he intended to plead guilty before the Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH)). In support of the first ground, it is argued that “
the overall guidance from the Court of Appeal in relation to [cases such as this] is that the starting point would not exceed 20 years as a very top figure and 18 would be appropriate
”. Counsel emphasises the circumstances of the applicant, and particularly his age and lack of relevant convictions, and it is suggested the judge erred as to the starting point he identified.
15.
As regards the discount for plea, counsel cites
R v Underwood
[2004] EWCA Crim 2256
;
[2005] 1 Cr App R 13
. p. 178 in which it was indicated that if any factual issues in dispute between the prosecution and the defence are resolved entirely in the accused’s favour, credit should not be withheld. However, we note that the court went on to add that if the defendant showed no insight into the consequences of his offence and no genuine remorse, then the discount may be reduced [11]. Furthermore, it is to be observed that although Cooke pleaded guilty on 12 March 2012, he submitted more than one basis of plea, and on 14 July 2012 he only accepted he was an organiser of the distribution of drugs in Wales and Scotland, and he denied involvement in the activities in Cheshire and Lancashire. He suggested his involvement related to low purity class A drugs, and he contended he was concerned with no more than 3 kilograms of heroin and up to 20 kilograms of heavily diluted cocaine.
16.
We have already addressed the issue of the starting point for defendants dealing in drugs at the level of these applicants. In refusing leave the single judge observed “
having regard in particular to the part played in the conspiracy by the applicant, the scale of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved, the judge’s starting point of 23 years, whilst severe, cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive
”. We would add that given the particular role of this applicant, which was that of a singularly active controller of an extensive drug-supply enterprise, the severity of the sentence was entirely appropriate.
17.
As set out above, the applicant tendered his guilty plea at the PCMH in March 2012 on a basis of plea which was revised in July 2012. At the date set for a Newton hearing on 1 August 2012, he did not pursue that revised basis of plea. His decision had been communicated to the prosecution in advance of the hearing. Given he advanced, as set out above, the proposition that he had not been involved in the operations in Lancashire and Cheshire, and he had been concerned with only a small amount of heroin and 20 kilograms of low grade cocaine, we are – without hesitation – of the view that the sentencing judge was fully justified in reducing the credit accorded to the applicant to about 25% to reflect the fact that his plea was for a significant period unjustifiably limited and qualified.
18.
Accordingly, the sentence of 17 years cannot arguably be faulted and his application is dismissed.
19.
James Jack Swarez
is 44 years of age. He was sentenced to 17 years’ imprisonment, with a starting point of 20 years’ imprisonment. The judge found that he was at the heart of the conspiracy in Liverpool and he was, more generally, heavily involved in this criminal enterprise, most notably in Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire but also in Scotland.
He played an organisational and leading role; he was present at significant meetings; and he directed and controlled operations, albeit just below Cooke (the Crown described his role as “
slightly subordinate
” to Cooke). The judge found during the Newton hearing for this applicant that he was an organiser who was “on the board of directors”, although he was not the managing director. He disbelieved the applicant’s evidence in a significant number of respects. In a lengthy and careful ruling the judge analysed Swarez’s movements, the telephone calls and his contact with other conspirators, leading to the conclusion that he had a controlling role. The judge isolated and analysed particular key days and events in support of this conclusion, such as 12 July 2011 (the Pond Restaurant day), 28 July 2011 (the Coastal Southport day), 1 September 2011 (the day of Law’s arrest) and 13 October 2011 (the Hob Inn day). He accepted that this applicant had been involved in some legitimate building works but he rejected many of Swarez’s other contentions, such as the reasons why he visited Wales on a number of occasions.
20.
His offending was, in the view of the learned judge, aggravated by a conviction in 1995 for conspiracy to supply ecstasy for which he received a sentence of 4 years imprisonment.
21.
In support of this application it is argued that the judge’s findings did not sufficiently reflect the difference in the respective positions of Cooke and this applicant, and it is suggested the judge gave insufficient credit for his guilty plea notwithstanding the fact that he fought an unsuccessful Newton hearing. Accordingly, it is argued that the starting point for Swarez was too high and he should have been accorded more than 15% credit. It is observed that witnesses were not called during his Newton hearing and the evidence of the officers was not challenged. It is said that some activity had taken place before the applicant became involved in the conspiracy and that generally the evidence demonstrated that Cooke was “
far superior
” to Swarez in the hierarchy. It was contended that there is no evidence to suggest that this applicant was involved throughout the conspiracy, and – consistent with that submission – the telephone evidence only implicated him to a limited extent. This, it is argued, raises the question as to the true nature of his role. Put otherwise, it is suggested that Cooke had regular control and there was less activity by Swarez, and the few trips on his part may simply have been in the role of a courier. In this context, it is highlighted that Jolly and Swarez tended to be in contact after meetings with Cooke, which would tend to reveal that a consignment had been delivered.
22.
The single judge, when addressing whether the starting point was too high, concluded that having regard in particular to the part which the sentencing judge found that the applicant had played in the conspiracy, the scale of the enterprise, the amount of drugs involved and the applicant’s previous conviction for supplying ecstasy, the starting point of 20 years, whilst severe, cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive. We concur with that observation. The judge was entitled to conclude that Swarez controlled and directed aspects of this criminal enterprise, and enabled a very large quantity of Class A drugs to be supplied, to a number of areas. He issued instructions to subordinates and he operated at the heart of the conspiracy, albeit below Cooke. In
R v Khan
(
supra
) Treacy LJ in giving the judgment of the court observed:
“32. Many conspiracies will involve multiple supply transactions. In those circumstances the judge would be entitled to look at the aggregate quantity of the drug involved.
33. Of course involvement in a conspiracy may vary for individual offenders within it. One core variant is culpability, which is demonstrated in the guideline by the role of the offender, and which is to be assessed by the non-exhaustive indicative factors set out in the guideline. That will enable the judge to assess the level of involvement of an individual within a conspiracy.
34. However, a particular individual within a conspiracy may be shown only to have been involved for a particular period during the conspiracy, or to have been involved only in certain transactions within the conspiracy, or otherwise to have had an identifiably smaller part in the whole conspiracy. In such circumstances the judge should have regard to those factors which limit an individual's part relative to the whole conspiracy. It will be appropriate for the judge to reflect that in sentence, perhaps by adjusting the category to one better reflecting the reality.
35. As a balancing factor, however, the court is entitled to reflect the fact that the offender has been part of a wider course of criminal activity. The fact of involvement in a conspiracy is an aggravating feature since each conspirator playing his part gives comfort and assistance to others knowing that he is doing so, and the greater his or her awareness of the scale of the enterprise in which he is assisting, the greater his culpability.”
23.
We entirely agree with those conclusions, and simply add that the central organisers may well not be involved personally in each and every transaction and instead the judge will need to focus on their overall position in the hierarchy and the particular role that they played. Although defendants in a position of authority may have joined the enterprise at some stage after the conspiracy began and they may not have featured in every aspect of the operation, this does not necessarily lead to a reduction in the level of sentence.
24.
As to the limited credit for the applicant’s guilty plea, this was tendered at the PCMH in March 2012 on a significantly restricted basis. There was a 3-day Newton hearing at which the applicant’s evidence was rejected. In the circumstances, the judge was fully justified in reducing the credit accorded to the applicant to 15%. The judge recognised his lesser to role to that of Cooke, and in the event the sentence of 17 years cannot credibly be criticised.
25.
Paul McDonald
is 45 years of age. He was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, with a starting point of 20 years’ imprisonment. The judge determined that he was a major player within the network; he had a leading and an active role, and he was always able to obtain large quantities of heroin. As a result he supplied very large quantities of heroin to the organisers of the conspiracy, although he was not their exclusive supplier and they were not his only customers. The sheer quantities of heroin supplied by McDonald need emphasising: as a single example, on 26 October 2011, together with Harrison, this applicant supplied 5 kilograms of heroin to Coburn in Blackpool of 25 – 26% purity. He was connected (
via
Caddock and Jolly) to the Scottish limb of this conspiracy and the delivery of drugs in that country on 4 July 2011. McDonald was wholly undeterred by the arrest of other conspirators when they were in possession of very large quantities of drugs (
viz.
the arrests of Petherick in Wales on 13 September 2011 with one kilogram of cocaine and Jolly on 22 September 2011 with two kilograms of heroin). McDonald tried to call Jolly following his arrest, and he continued supplying class A drugs notwithstanding that event.
26.
In passing sentence, the judge indicated that McDonald had played a leading role because he was supplying very large quantities of heroin to the organisers of the conspiracy, as one of the individuals fulfilling that role. The judge described McDonald thus: “
You were hands on and you were always able to get your hands on large quantities of heroin. In my judgment, you were a major player in this network
”.
27.
The judge concluded that his offending was aggravated by a conviction in 1997 for being concerned in the supply of drugs for which he received a sentence of 3 years imprisonment.
28.
In his grounds of appeal, the applicant suggests the judge adopted too high a starting point, in that he failed to give sufficient allowance for what is said to be the applicant’s true role and his overall level of responsibility and activity. It is argued that the observation evidence reveals that only about 14 kilograms of heroin are sustainably linked with this appellant and that there is no evidence that he was involved in dealing with cocaine. In those circumstances it is suggested that he was not one of those running the conspiracy, bearing in mind he was only one of a number of suppliers. His position is compared with McCreadie who was “
running
” the Scottish limb of this criminal enterprise, to whom 18 kilograms of heroin are associated. He had relevant class A previous convictions, and was given a starting point of 19 years. In those circumstances it is argued that McCreadie’s starting point is out of line with that identified for McDonald.
29.
Finally, it is submitted the judge fell into error in not allowing the applicant full credit for his plea, which was entered at the PCMH on 12 March 2012. The judge ordered that a basis of plea was to be submitted in early May, for the Crown’s consideration. It was served on 2 May 2012, and McDonald contended therein that he should only be sentenced on the basis of the seizures and not on any inferences that the Crown invited the Court to draw from the other evidence in the case. It was not suggested by the prosecution that this was an unrealistic and unacceptable basis until 15 June 2012, shortly before the hearing that had been set down for 29 June 2012 when the court proposed investigating whether Newton Hearings were necessary. Although McDonald’s lawyers had difficulties visiting him in prison, it was indicated to the judge on the 29 June 2012 in open court they would not be pursuing the suggestion that he should be sentenced only on the basis of “
actual
” seizures. However, counsel needed to obtain McDonald’s instructions on the issue, which it was expected would be provided on 6 July 2012. The judge then indicated: “
If I take the view that he is not entitled to full credit, the reduction from full credit will be small […]”.
McDonald’s lawyers confirmed his instructions, which were communicated to prosecution counsel at the end of the following week by telephone and repeated in a letter on 23 July 2012.
30.
By the time of the sentencing hearing this exchange was interpreted in submissions by prosecuting counsel as “
on 23 July you indicated […] that Mr McDonald should expect a minimum of 25 % credit but that a maximum may not be available
”.
31.
Against that background, it is argued that McDonald abandoned his short-lived attempt to dilute the basis on which he was to be sentenced at an early stage – considerably in advance of any Newton Hearing – and accordingly there should have been no, alternatively only slight, reduction from full credit in those circumstances.
32.
In the view of the single judge, having regard in particular to the part played in the conspiracy by McDonald, the scale of the conspiracy, the amount of drugs involved and the applicant’s previous conviction for supplying drugs, the judge’s starting point of 20 years, whilst severe, cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive. We agree unreservedly with that conclusion. McDonald was a substantial dealer in heroin, trading in very large quantities. The judge was entitled to view him as an organiser who played a leading role. He would have been aware that there were other suppliers and he nonetheless continued to associate with this criminal enterprise. It was not necessary to link him to every delivery of drugs to those involved in the conspiracy.
33.
On the issue of the discount for plea, as set out above, the applicant tendered his plea of guilty at the PCMH on 12 March 2012. On 2 May 2012, he tendered a basis of plea which was subsequently withdrawn substantially before the date set for the Newton hearing on 1 August 2012. Given the prosecution did not object to the suggested basis of plea until 15 June 2012 and the observation of the judge on 29 June 2012 that the reduction from full credit for his plea would be slight (creating a strong expectation in the mind of the applicant), it was wrong in principle for the judge to reduce his credit to 25% (a reduction that cannot sustainably be described as “
small
”). Given the applicant did not accept the full extent of his criminality at the outset, the credit should have been approximately 30%. Otherwise, given the quantities of drugs with which this applicant was involved, the 20 years starting point was wholly appropriate. Having adjusted the credit by 5%, the sentence will be 14 years. We grant leave and adjust the sentence to this limited extent.
34.
James Richard Beck
is 49 years of age. He was sentenced to 13 years’ imprisonment, following a trial. He had a close relationship with Jolly with whom he was seen on many occasions, and he attended a significant number of meetings and purchased drugs from the organisers. He received drugs from Jolly at his home in Lancashire for onward distribution at least 6 times. The learned judge acknowledged that in his case the quantities involved were difficult to determine, save that the amounts were smaller in Lancashire than those in Wales and Scotland. However, it was observed that following Jolly’s arrest he continued to trade and this applicant was involved in supplying heroin in quantities of a number of kilograms. For instance, when Jolly was arrested on 22 September the 2 kilograms of heroin in his possession were destined for this applicant. Beck bought drugs from Cooke and Swarez which he sold on to others.
35.
He has no relevant previous convictions in the sense that his previous drugs offences relate to possession of cannabis in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
36.
This application is put on the basis that the judge adopted too high a starting point in relation to the applicant’s role in the conspiracy.
37.
In our judgment, the single judge correctly observed that since the trial judge had presided over the applicant’s trial he was particularly well placed to assess his involvement in the conspiracy. As just summarised, the judge concluded wholly sustainably that Jolly’s six visits to the applicant’s home between June and September 2011 related to drug dealing, and that the applicant was buying drugs from Cooke and Swarez and selling them in his own right. The 2 kilos in the possession of Jolly when he was arrested on 22 September 2011 were intended for this applicant. In our view, give the scale of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved, the applicant’s sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment, following his trial, was not manifestly excessive.
38.
Jonathan Paul Cromwell
is 37 years of age and was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment, with a starting point of 16 years’ imprisonment. He has no relevant aggravating convictions (his previous drugs offences are all spent, and they relate to events between 10 and 20 years ago). The judge correctly determined that in the context of this enterprise he was a significant drugs dealer in his own right, who was involved in the conspiracy from June 2011. He was part of the group in Wales and certainly in the latter stages he acted in as a middleman, in that from September he became more significantly involved and he was sighted on a number of occasions when large consignments of drugs were being distributed. He identified large amounts of drugs in Liverpool for purchase and he had close contacts with the organisers who supplied him with drugs in kilogram quantities.
39.
The author of his pre-sentence report suggests that his offending was the result of financial difficulties and he was assessed as posing a high risk of re-offending.
40.
This application is put on the basis that the judge was wrong not to give the applicant full credit for his guilty plea and the judge failed to reflect sufficiently the fact that he was not one of the original conspirators, that his role developed during the period of his involvement and that he was not the leader of the operation in Wales. Taking the latter issue, it is suggested that although he was an independent actor, he was dealt with on an inappropriate basis. There were 19 relevant trips to South Wales out of a total of 27. The purity of the drugs was at a low level – 18 to 25% – and the total amount involved in his case was 4 - 5 kilograms. It is contended that he straddled a leading and a significant role. Additionally, it is suggested the judge set the sentence for this applicant too high at 16 years (on the basis of a conviction following a not guilty plea) when a starting point of 14 years was considered appropriate for the co-accused Wildman. However, the prosecution argues that his position is not analogous to that of Wildman, who was more of a 'gofer'.
41.
The applicant pleaded guilty on 12 March 2012, on a basis which was not accepted by the prosecution. In the event the applicant did not pursue the basis he suggested at a Newton hearing: he had sought to limit the period of his involvement by 2 months (it was suggested his role commenced in August) and he asserted he was not a dealer but a courier and a middleman. This was rejected by the prosecution and following discussions around 27 June 2012, this basis of plea was withdrawn and the applicant acknowledged he had been involved since June.
42.
It is suggested that since there was no Newton hearing, there should have been no, alternately a lesser, reduction in credit for his plea. However, having regard to the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty on a limited basis, in our judgment the judge was fully entitled to reduce his credit to 25%, and unlike the position with McDonald no legitimate expectation was created as regards the extent of the reduction for the credit that was to accompany the guilty plea. Moreover, we agree with the single judge that having regard in particular to the applicant’s involvement in the conspiracy (he graduated rapidly into becoming a significant participant in the enterprise), the scale of this criminal enterprise in which he participated and the amount of drugs involved, the judge’s starting point of 16 years’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive, and the sentence of 12 years was wholly appropriate.
43.
David Robert Jolly
is 46 years of age. He was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment, with a starting point of 18 years’ imprisonment. He has relevant previous convictions. He was a very active, trusted and professional courier who played a very significant role and who acted as a middleman between the organisers and their dealings with James Beck. He reported to the organisers, he delivered (on a conservative estimate) 25 kg of drugs to the four areas: Scotland (which he visited on at least 18 occasions), South Wales, Lancashire and Cheshire until his arrest on 22
nd
September 2011. He collected payment on behalf of the organisers and he was present at important meetings.
44.
He seeks an extension of time, approximately 14 days, in which to renew his application for leave to appeal against sentence and for a representation order after refusal by the single judge. In support of the application to extend time, the history relied on is that the judge refused leave on 18
th
December 2012. The refusal form was sent to the applicant on 31
st
December 2012 and received by him on 7
th
January 2013. He suggests he handed the completed form to the prison officer on 11
th
January 2013. Enquiries were subsequently made with the prison records department who stated they had no record of having received the single judge’s form from the applicant or having sent a relevant fax message to the court. The renewal form was then re-submitted in identical form as the one completed in January. We have given the applicant the benefit of the doubt as regards the suggested breakdown in the system and we grant the extension of time.
45.
In support of the renewed application, it is argued the judge incorrectly ascribed to the applicant a role which was inconsistent with the evidence in that he should not have been viewed as a “
middleman between others and Cooke
”. In consequence it is suggested a starting point of 18 years was wrong. Further it is argued that the judge failed to reflect the applicant’s remorse and his admissions in interview. In additional submissions received since the single judge considered his case, it is pointed out that the applicant has no previous drug-related convictions; Law and McCreadie were on licence for an offence concerning the importation of drugs; and the applicant was fully co-operative with the police.
46.
In our judgment, on the evidence, the judge was fully entitled to conclude that the applicant was an active courier who had transported, as we have just observed, not less than 25 kilos of Class A drugs. He provided a critical link and conduit between the leaders of the conspiracy, Cooke and Swarez, and another conspirator, Beck. He was clearly involved with all four areas in which drugs were distributed and he had dealings with the lead conspirators, particularly at meetings. Given that involvement, the scale of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved, we consider the single judge was wholly correct in her view that this sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment (representing 18 years’ imprisonment after a trial) is not manifestly excessive.
47.
John Frederick Wildman
is 41 years of age. He was sentenced to 9 years 4 months’ imprisonment with a starting point of 14 years’ imprisonment. He was active and “
hands on
” throughout the conspiracy “
at the Liverpool end
” and, on the evidence before the judge, as a trusted assistant to the organisers who gave him numerous tasks to perform, and he was seemingly entirely aware of their activities. He was close to a number of the conspirators and the observation evidence revealed the scale of his involvement in this conspiracy: he was an extremely active participant who was seen at many of the relevant locations with a number of participants in this criminality. Accordingly, although he played a lesser role, he was “
very much hands on
”, to use the judge’s expression to which we have just referred. There was significant telephone contact between Wildman and Cook and Swarez and he delivered drugs to Cardiff and elsewhere.
48.
He has no relevant previous convictions, in that his previous drugs involvement is limited to possession of cocaine in 2002. There was no basis of plea submitted and the applicant accepted the prosecution case.
49.
The author of his pre-sentence report indicated that Wildman accepted responsibility for his actions but claimed he was entirely unaware of the true activities of his co-accused. He suggested to the probation officer that others had taken advantage of him and he had been “
used
” by the organisers. He contended that he routinely agreed to act for Swarez as a driver on the understanding that he would receive legitimate labouring work on properties allegedly owned by Swarez. The applicant’s counsel candidly accepted during mitigation before the learned judge that the pre-sentence report falsely purported to minimise his role and culpability, and he had little personal mitigation save for the support of his wife, a favourable report from the Prison Service and a reference from an employer. He is said to be a vulnerable man, who has had little education and is unable to read or write.
50.
It is argued that he was a trusted drug mule (the trusted assistant of Cook and Swarez), but he was not a worldly wise man. Against that background, this renewed application is advanced on the basis the judge adopted too high a starting point for the applicant in the context of the conspiracy.
51.
However, in our judgment, given the role the judge justifiably identified as played by the applicant in this conspiracy, as a trusted and active lieutenant, and bearing in mind the scale of the operation and the amount of drugs involved, the judge’s starting point of 14 years’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive.
52.

1.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: The Court as presently constituted heard this appeal on 3rd September. That was, of course, during the long vacation. It was indicated then that judgment would be reserved to be handed down at a later date. In fact the judgment in draft was sent out to counsel on 17th October. It was indicated that it was due to be handed down formally on 23rd October.
2.
In the meantime the Court came to appreciate that there might be a point which needed to be argued which had not been argued on the first occasion, namely, having regard to the conclusions reached by this Court, whether it could still be said that the conviction was safe. Accordingly, the Court took the slightly unusual step of informing counsel then appearing for the appellant that it would be prepared to entertain further argument on a date convenient to herself, that date being today, with argument being limited, of course, to the one matter.
3.
It appears, though we will hear explanation in a moment or two no doubt, that in the meantime the appellant has dispensed with the services of leading counsel. So it would appear that he is here today to represent himself.
4.
THE CASE LAWYER: I am Dr Paul Burns, the case lawyer. I am actually the case lawyer.
5.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: I am so sorry. Mr Kelleher is not here today?
6.
MR LADENBURG: No, my Lord.
7.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: That is most unfortunate. We are confident, are we, that he was given due notice of this hearing?
8.
THE CASE LAWYER: Certainly he was aware of the hearing date because he had actually been in discussion with his legal representatives and had actually seen them and he was aware that this was the date.
9.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: Well, it is doubly unfortunate then that he should no longer, so it appears, be represented, or present. I think the Court will adjourn for, perhaps, ten minutes or so to allow him a further opportunity to make an appearance. (
Pause
). The Court has been informed, and perhaps this ought to go on the transcript, that someone who knows Mr Kelleher is outside the Court and his understanding is that Mr Kelleher is intending to attend. We will rise for a little while.

LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: Before you arrived, Mr Kelleher, I was explaining that the hearing of this appeal took place on 3rd September.
11.
THE APPELLANT: Yes, my Lord.
12.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: It was then indicated that the judgment would be reserved to be handed down later. The draft judgment was sent out to counsel on 17th October, just over a fortnight, after the start of term, and it was due to be handed down on 23rd October.
13.
In the meantime the Court appreciated that in the light of its decision, as indicated in that draft judgment, it may be that counsel then appearing for you would wish to have an opportunity to argue, or submit that, notwithstanding the provisional judgment arrived at, it would not be safe to uphold the conviction. Accordingly, I took the unusual step of speaking to your leading counsel, then acting on your before, and said that we would be prepared to hear further argument in respect of that point, and that point alone, and today was set aside for the further hearing. Our understanding, which you will be able to confirm or not as the case may be, is that in the meantime you have dispensed with the services of counsel?
14.
THE APPELLANT: My Lord, I am left with no real alternatives. As these matters were pressed, I was pressed into a corner where my life is completely unsustainable.
15.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: As to whether that was a wise decision or not we express no opinion, but we are now giving you, in place of your counsel, the opportunity to make some submissions, if you think fit, as to that one point and that one point. Do you wish to make any?
16.
THE APPELLANT: Yes, my Lord. ...

JUDGMENT
17.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL:
In this appeal the Court is invited to examine, once again, the breadth of the defence of ""lawful excuse"" to a charge of criminal damage. We say ""once again"" because the question has previously been considered by this court in
R v Hunt
(1978) 66 Cr App R 105
,
R v Ashford and Smith
(1988) Crim LR 682 and
R v Hill and Hall
89 Cr App R 74
. The Court is also asked to consider in what circumstances, if any, a judge is entitled to direct a verdict of guilty.
18.
It comes about in this way. Paul Kelleher has strong and sincerely felt concerns about certain policies of the United States, the United Kingdom and other western countries which, he foresees, are leading the world towards its eventual destruction. He is particularly troubled about the future of his infant son and others in like circumstances. Among his bugbears are the prevailing materialistic values and the influence which major corporations seem to be able to exercise over supposedly democratic governments. Baroness Thatcher is among those he holds responsible.
19.
So it was on 3rd July 2002 he visited the Guildhall Gallery, which houses the Corporation of London art collection, armed with a cricket bat and with the intention of knocking the head off a statue of Lady Thatcher, that statue being on temporary loan from the House of Commons. The cricket bat proving ineffectual, Mr Kelleher took hold of a metal stanchion, which supported the cordon round the statue, and with that was able to achieve his purpose. We understand that the statue was damaged beyond repair and will cost £150,000 to replace.
20.
Having done what he set out to do, Mr Kelleher calmly awaited the arrival of the police. To them he explained his philosophy and his motives. At one point he said, ""I fear genuinely for the future of my son. I don't believe he has a very rosy outlook to life"". He made it plain that in acting as he did he was seeking publicity for his views in the hope that, if accepted by others, they might bring about improvements in the world situation.
21.
He was charged with criminal damage. In the first instance he stood trial at Southwark Crown Court before Aikens J and a jury. He represented himself. None of the Crown's evidence was in dispute and all of it was read. In his defence Mr Kelleher read from a prepared statement in the course of which he once again explained his philosophy and his motives. This passage occurs:
""If humanity is so intent of going to its own destruction then this is my play for the Crown and this is me being intent going to my own destruction. I do not want my children to grow up in a world where the order of the day is for mankind to act like dangerous parasites, stripping all that is good from each other and this fine planet earth. To do so is to leave nothingness, unless you call living hell something. 'Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' - really!""
22.
The learned judge was troubled about how to leave the matter to the jury. He raised it with prosecuting counsel. He wanted to know whether ""lawful excuse"" was an available defence and whether it should be left to the jury. Prosecuting counsel conceded that on a broad interpretation of the statutory provision, read in conjunction with the
Human Rights Act 1998
and Article 1 of Protocol 1(1) to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as amended, the defence was available. Aikens J summed up accordingly. The jury failed to reach a verdict and was discharged.
23.
The retrial took place on 22nd January this year, again at Southwark Crown Court, but this time presided over by His Honour Judge Bathhurst-Norman. HHJ Bathhurst-Norman took the view that what Mr Kelleher was saying, in all material respects being no different from what he had said in the earlier trial, did not engage the statutory defence available under the Act. He so ruled and in due course directed the jury as follows:
""I have used the words 'lawful excuse'. I have to decide as a matter of law whether there is anything in the defendant's evidence which is capable of amounting to a lawful excuse. I have to tell you as a matter of law, his evidence and everything he has said, clearly very sincerely, clearly very honestly, but it does not amount to a lawful excuse. As matter of law his reasons for his action by way of political beliefs, anti-globalisation belief, cannot -- his need to protect his son as he sees it -- amount to a lawful excuse. I say that because even though he honestly believes that what he did was justified by his dislike of Mrs Thatchers' policies in tying us too close to the United States in pursuing the aims of globalisation, and as he sees it, in the need to protect the safety and future of his son, he had no property belonging to himself which was in need of protection and no right or interest which was in immediate danger so as to need immediate protection. Even if he had such a right, the means adopted -- in other words knocking the head of the statute off -- were not reasonable having regard to all of the circumstances, that action in itself was not capable of protecting anyone's property, it was not even going to begin to achieve his objective.
The law in this field is really within a very narrow [
compass
]. Let me give you a simple example. If, for instance, I see the wall of your house bulging so far that I think it is going to fall down and damage the wall of my house and I go out and knock it down, that would be me acting in protection of my own property which was in immediate danger because of the fear of your wall falling down on it. Another simple example: If I have a right of way across your land and you put up a gate to stop me exercising it, then I will be acting in protection of my proprietary interests in that right of way if I knocked the gate down. That is the field in which lawful excuse arises. It is defined very narrowly within the Statute. Therefore, in the light of what the defendant admits that he did, I must direct you that there can only be one verdict in this case and that is one of guilty. The case is nothing to with whether you like or dislike Mrs Thatcher: Whether you like or dislike her policies, it is simply a question of, whether as a matter of law it amounts to criminal damage.""
24.
Mr Kelleher was convicted and sentenced to a term of three months' imprisonment.
He now appeals against that conviction with leave of the single judge.
25.
The grounds relied upon are that: (i)
the judge was wrong to rule as a matter of law the defence was unavailable; and (ii)
, in any event, was wrong to direct the jury to return a verdict of guilty.
26.
We take those grounds in turn.
We begin by setting out the relevant statutory provisions.
Section 1(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971
provides:
""A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.""
27.
It is further provided by section 5 as follows:
""5(1) This section applies to any offence under
section 1(1)
above [simple criminal damage] ...
(2)
A person charged with an offence to which this section applies shall, whether or not he would be treated for the purposes of this Act as having a lawful excuse apart from this subsection, be treated for those purposes as having a lawful excuse --
(a) ...
(b) if he destroyed or damaged or threatened to destroy or damage the property in question or ... in order to protect property belonging to himself or another or a right or interest in property which was or which he believed to be vested in himself or another, and at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed --
(i) that the property, right or interest was in immediate need of protection; and.
(ii) that the means of protection adopted or proposed to be adopted were or would be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.
(3)
For the purposes of this section it is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (2) above a right of interest in property includes any right or privilege in or over land, whether created by grant, licence or otherwise.
(5)
This section shall not be construed as casting doubt on any defence recognised by law as a defence to criminal charges.""
28.
In
R v Hunt
the appellant had been charged with setting fire to a guest room in an old people's home. He claimed that he had done so to draw attention to a defective fire alarm system. He sought to set up a statutory defence under section 5(2) by claiming to have had a lawful excuse in doing what he did. The trial judge withdrew the defence from the jury. In giving the judgment of this Court Roskill LJ, as he then was, said at page 108:
""I have said that we will assume in his favour that he possessed the requisite honest belief. But in our view the question whether he was entitled to the benefit of the defence turned upon the meaning of the words 'in order to protect property belonging to another'. It was argued that those words were subjective in concept, just like the words in the latter part of section 5(2)(b) which are subjective. We do not think that is right. The question whether or not a particular act of destruction or damage or threat of destruction or damage was done or made in order to protect property belonging to another must be, on a true construction of the statute, an objective test. Therefore we have to ask ourselves whether, whatever the state of this man's mind and assuming an honest belief, that which he admittedly did was done in order to protect this particular property, namely the old people's home in Hertfordshire? If one formulates the question in that way, in the view of each member of this court, for the reasons Slynn J gave during argument, it admits of only one answer: this was not done in order to protect property; it was done in order to draw attention to the defective state of the fire alarm. It was not an act which in itself did protect or was capable of protecting property.""
29.
That approach was followed in
Ashford and Smith
where the appellants had attempted to cut the wire fence surrounding an American Air Force base to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. They were charged with possession of an article with intent to damage property. The judge ruled that the purported reason for having the articles did not fall within the definition of a lawful excuse and, therefore, no evidence to that effect could be called. A ground of appeal was that the judge erred in so ruling. Following the reasoning in
Hunt
the Court held that whether or not an act was done or made in order to protect property belonging to another must be, on the true construction of the statute, an objective test and the judge had ruled correctly.
30.
In a trenchant criticism of the decision Professor Sir John Smith in his commentary to the report beginning at page 683 suggested:
""... that the result could only be achieved by 'a gross distortion of the words of the statute, reading it as if the words, 'in order to', read, 'by an act likely to.'""
31.
Nevertheless, the passage from Roskill LJ's judgment was cited with approval by the Court in
R v Hill and Hall
. That was another case where the applicants, for such they were, were separately tried on an indictment charging possession of an article with intent to damage property contrary to
section 3 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971
. In each case the article in question was a hacksaw blade and it was the prosecution case that each of the applicants intended to use one to cut part of the perimeter fence of a United States Naval Facility. The defence in each case was one of lawful excuse. It was put forward that the actions were aimed at forcing the United Kingdom to abandon nuclear weapons; thereby saving their own property and that of their neighbours from destruction.
32.
The trial judge in each case had directed the jury to convict on the basis, first, that the causative relationship between the acts and the alleged protection was so tenuous and nebulous the acts could not, objectively, have amounted to protection. On applications to appeal against conviction it was contended that the test was a subjective one and that it should have been left to the jury as a question of fact as to what in each case the applicant believed. A further point was taken that the judge had been wrong to direct the jury to convict. That second ground is a matter to which we shall have to return.
33.
Having stated that the decision in
Hunt
was correctly decided and, in any event, binding upon the Court, Lord Lane, Chief Justice, giving the judgment of the Court, went on to say:
""There are two aspects to this type of question. The first aspect is to decide what it was that the applicant in this case, Valerie Hill, in her own mind thought. The learned judge assumed, and so do we, for the purposes of this decision, that everything she said about her reasoning was true. I have already perhaps given a sufficient outline of what it was she believed to demonstrate what is meant by that. Up to that point the test was subjective. In other words one is examining what is going on in the applicant's mind.
Having done that the judges in the present cases and the judge particularly in the case of Valerie Hill turned to the second aspect of the case and that is this. He had to decide as a matter of law, which means objectively, whether it could be said that on those facts as believed by the applicant, snipping the strand of wire, which she intended to do, could amount to something done to protect either the applicant's own home or the home of her adjacent friends in Pembrokeshire.
He decided again quite rightly in our view that that proposed act on her part was far too remote from the eventual aim at which she was targeting her actions to satisfy the test.""
34.
We, too, are bound by the decisions in
Hunt
,
Ashford and Smith
and
Hill and Hall
. If it were necessary to do so we would also agree with the construction of the section adopted by this Court in those cases. Of course, Professor Sir John Smith is right to say that the words ""in order to"" involve a consideration of a defendant's state of mind, but what a judge has to decide is whether the defence of lawful excuse is raised on the evidence. In other words, does the declared or stated purpose engage the subsection?
35.
In our view the trial judge was right to conclude that the appellant's stated purpose in damaging the statue did not raise the defence of lawful excuse for the jury's consideration. If we have any criticism at all of his direction it is simply that it fails to make reference to property belonging to ""another"" or a right or interest in property which he believed to be vested in ""another"". It seems to us, however, that on the evidence of the appellant himself the defence was unavailable whether by reference to his own property or right or interest, or that of anyone else. Accordingly, we would hold that the judge was entitled, and indeed correct, to withdraw the defence from the jury.
36.
But was he entitled and correct to direct the jury as he did? So long as a defendant remains in the charge of the jury he or she can only be acquitted or convicted by the verdict of the jury. If authority is required for that trite proposition see
R v Heyes
[1951] 1 KB at 29. Where, as not uncommonly happens, a defendant having put himself upon his country (ponit se super patriam) wishes to change his plea to one of guilty, then, with leave of the judge, the indictment may be put again and a new plea entered in the presence of the jury, following which the jury may be invited to return a verdict there and then. An alternative, sometimes employed, might be to discharge the jury and allow the defendant to be re-arraigned. That, however, leaves open the possibility of abuse by a manipulative defendant. Even where there has been a change of plea from not guilty to guilty to a count on the indictment and that has occurred in the presence of the jury it is not the usual practice (query whether it could ever be the correct practice) for the judge to direct a verdict of guilty. He or she will usually invite someone to act as foreman, explain what has happened, say that what they have listened to may seem to them to be the strongest possible evidence of guilt, invite consultation without retirement and then to take a verdict which invariably will be one of guilty.
37.
To that extent the practice differs from that adopted following a ruling of ""no case"". There the judge will direct an acquittal and the verdict is returned ""by direction of the judge"". The distinction was underlined in the well-known case of
DPP v Stonehouse
(1977) 65 Cr App R 192
,
[1978] AC 55
and particularly in the speech of Lord Salmon at pages 219 and pages 79-80 respectively:
""Whilst there is no doubt that if a judge is satisfied that there is no evidence before the jury which could justify them in convicting the accused and that it would be perverse for them to do so, it is the judge's duty to direct them to acquit. This rule, which has long been established, is to protect the accused against being wrongly convicted. But there is no converse rule -- although there are some who think there should be.""
38.
The majority decision in that case was to the effect that there can never be circumstances in which it would be right for a judge to direct a conviction in terms. To continue the quotation from Lord Salmon's speech:
""If the judge is satisfied that, on the evidence, the jury would not be justified in acquitting the accused and indeed that it would be perverse of them to do so, he has no power to pre-empt the jury's verdict by directing them to convict. The jury alone have the power to decide that the accused is guilty. In an appropriate case (and this was certainly such a case) the judge may sum up in such a way as to make it plain that he considers that the accused is guilty and should be convicted. I doubt however whether the most effective way of doing so would for the judge to tell the judge to tell the jury that it would be perverse for them to acquit. Such a course might be counter-productive.""
39.
R v Stonehouse
was followed and applied by this Court in
R v Gent
(1989) 89 Cr App R 247. In that case Lloyd LJ, as he then was, giving the judgment of the Court said.
""Whether or not there is still a category of rare cases where the judge is justified in directing a conviction, it is perhaps unnecessary to decide. There is no reference to any such cases in the speeches of the majority in
DPP v Stonehouse
; and the existence of such a category is inconsistent with the thrust of Lord Keith's speech at p.232 and p.94 respectively.
Our own view would be that, if such a category exists at all, it must be confined to wholly exceptional cases where, for example, there has been something in the nature of a formal admission of guilt. The fact that on the evidence, including the evidence of the defendant himself, only one verdict is possible, does not justify the judge in directing the jury to convict. If the judge takes the view the defendant has, in the course of his evidence admitted his guilt then it is always open to him to give the defendant an opportunity, in the absence of the jury, to change his plea. But if he maintains his plea, the defendant is entitled to the verdict of a jury, even though in the view of the judge, an acquittal would be perverse.""
40.
Clearly the Court was suggesting that the opportunity to change plea, not any re-arraignment, should be in the absence of the jury. The usual practice was and remains that any change of plea should be tendered in the face of the jury who would then be in a position to act upon it in the manner previously indicated.
41.
Interestingly,
Gent
was decided the year following the decision of this Court in
Hill and Hall
.
Hill and Hall
does not appear to have been cited in argument and certainly is not referred to in the judgment. In each of the cases of
Hill and Hall
the judge had in effect directed a verdict of guilty. The Court referred to the case of
Stonehouse
and to the passages which we have recited at an earlier place in this judgment, making the distinction between a direction to convict based on the Crown's affirmative case and the withdrawal of a defence which was unsupported by evidence. This is what was said by the Lord Chief Justice at page 81:
""The judge here was dealing with the defence of lawful excuse. Certainly the prosecution had to destroy that defence, but it was no part of their affirmative case. It bore a similarity to the defence of self-defence, and, as it that case, so in this, there was no need for the judge to direct the jury on those matters unless there was some evidence capable of constituting that defence. In fact there was none, as the judge in each case rightly held.""
42.
The Court then went on to say that there was no other issue and in that case the judge had been entitled to direct a verdict of guilty. For our part we can quite see the distinction between a ruling that a defendant has not satisfied the evidential burden necessary to raise a particular defence which may lead, quite properly, to the issue being removed from the jury's consideration, but, as it seems to us, in every case it will be necessary for the prosecution to establish an affirmative case. So even though it may be ruled, quite correctly, that the defence of lawful excuse is not available, it is still for the Crown to prove to the satisfaction of the jury that the offence of criminal damage has been committed. It matters not that the evidence is overwhelming, or even that by his evidence the appellant has seemingly admitted all the constituents of the offence; it remains for the jury to return its own voluntary verdict. For that reason and in this one respect we consider that the Court in
Hill and Hall
was in error.
43.
How does that affect the present appeal? This was not a case where the judge directed the jury in terms to convict. The jury was invited to retire, which they did, and in due course returned a verdict of guilty. It is the case, however, that the passage from the summing up already quoted includes the following:
""Therefore, in the light of what this defendant admits that he did, I must direct you that there can only be one verdict in this case and that is one of guilty.""
44.
Now whilst it is true that any other verdict might be regarded as perverse, and the judge would certainly have been entitled to say ""you may think that there can only be one verdict in this case and that is one of guilty"", it can hardly be denied that the words used could be taken as a direction to convict. We can well understand having read
Hill and Hall
how this conscientious judge came to express himself as he did and we certainly do not criticise his withdrawal of the defence of ""lawful excuse"". But in our view the general issue of guilt or innocence should have been left to the jury and the words used crossed the line which separates forceful comment from a direction to convict.
45.
One question remains. Was this conviction safe? The evidence was truly overwhelming. The appellant admitted the constituents of the offence. There was no defence available to him. Following a proper direction a verdict of guilty was or should have been inevitable. However, there is a difficulty. As was noted in
R v Davis & Others
(2001) 1 Cr App R 115
at 130 and following, there relying upon what was said in
Hickey & Others
CA July 30 1997, this Court is not concerned with the guilt or innocence of the appellant, but only with the safety of the conviction. As was said by Roch LJ giving the judgment of the court in
Hickey & Others
:
""This may, at first sight, appear an unsatisfactory state of affairs, until it is remembered that the integrity of the criminal process is the most important consideration for courts which have to hear appeals against conviction. If the trial process is not fair, if it is distorted by deceit or by material breaches of the rules of evidence or procedure, then the liberties of all are threatened.""
46.
As has already been noticed, so long as the defendant remains in charge of the jury only the jury can return a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Where there has been a direction to convict, therefore, can it be said that the verdict returned is the voluntary and therefore the true verdict of the jury and, further, if not, in such a case can it be said that there has been a conviction, let alone a safe conviction?
47.
In
R v Stonehouse
the complaint had been that the trial judge had failed to leave to the jury one of the constituents of an attempt. It was held that he had directed them to find that constituent proved. Nevertheless the Court was invited to apply the proviso to
section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
. Among the majority Lord Salmon said this (65 Cr App R at 219; (1978) AC at 79 respectively):
""Anyone in the judge's position might easily have made the slip which he did of not leaving the jury to decide whether the facts proved amounted to the attempt charged. However obvious it may be that they did and that the accused was guilty, technically, the judge should still have left it to the jury to decide whether or not the evidence established the attempt charge and have found him guilty or not guilty accordingly. The technical slip on the part of the judge certainly made no difference to the result of the trial. There is no possibility that any reasonable jury could have had the slightest doubt that the facts proved did establish the attempt charged and accordingly would certainly have brought in a verdict of guilty. I am completely satisfied that no miscarriage of justice could have resulted from what technically was a misdirection and that therefore the proviso to
section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
should be applied.""
48.
Lord Edmund Davis (pages 227 and 89 respectively) stated:
""In several cases of misdirection of the kind which occurred in the instant case, the conviction has been upheld where the court was convinced that, on a proper direction, the jury would have come to the same conclusion. Applying that generally accepted test to the present case and being satisfied that no miscarriage of justice resulted from the misdirection complained of, I would apply the proviso.""
49.
Lord Keith, also being of the ""majority"" and having agreed that it was never appropriate to give a direction to convict (pages 232 and 94 respectively), continued:
""While that is my view upon the matter of principle, I cannot in the circumstances of the present case regard the misdirection as being other than purely technical. I do not consider that in these circumstances any reasonable jury could have come to the conclusion, having accepted the evidence as to what the appellant did, that his actions were merely preparatory to an attempt such that was charged. I am therefore of the opinion that this is a clear case where no miscarriage has resulted from the misdirection, and which is therefore a proper one for the application of the proviso to
section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
.""
50.
It is clear that in
R v Gent
, the Court saw no difficulty in principle in applying the proviso although it was unpersuaded to do so having regard to the state of the evidence.
51.
We do not think that the approach has been changed significantly by the amendment to
section 2(1)
which requires the Court to allow an appeal where, for whatever reason, the conviction is considered unsafe. In
Davis and Others
the Court, having reviewed a number of authorities, attempted to extract certain principles. These appear at pages 131 and 132 of the judgment:
""The court is concerned with the safety of the conviction. A conviction can never be safe if there is a doubt about guilt. However, the converse is not true. A conviction may be unsafe even where there is no doubt about guilt but the trial process has been 'vitiated by serious unfairness or significant legal misdirection' as in
Smith (Patrick and Others)
and in
Weir
. Usually it will be sufficient for the court to apply the test in
Stirland
(1945) 30 Crim App R 40
1944 AC 315
, which as adapted by Mr Perry, might read:
'Assuming the wrong direction on law or the irregularity had not occurred and the trial had been free from legal error, would the only reasonable and proper verdict have been one of guilty?'""
52.
Applying that test and following the powerful precedent provided by the House of Lords in
R v Stonehouse
and notwithstanding the logical difficulty to which we have referred, we conclude that the conviction of Mr Kelleher is to be regarded as ""safe"". Accordingly his appeal against conviction must be dismissed.
53.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: Thank you both for attending.
54.
THE APPELLANT: My Lord, may I have a few moments of the Court's time for
section 12(4) of the Human Rights Act
, freedom of expression, and 13(1), freedom of thought, conscience and religion, please?
55.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: Have you got an application to make, Mr Kelleher?
56.
THE APPELLANT: Yes, my Lord.
57.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: What is it?
58.
THE APPELLANT: The application is that we now have to move this forward.
59.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: We have what?
60.
THE APPELLANT: To move this forward, my Lord. I suppose the most direct route would be the House of Lords next and then to the European Court of Human Rights. I am finding it very difficult to accept --
61.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: I think -- someone will help me I am sure -- I think you have got 14 days in which to prepare a question which you consider suitable for consideration by the House of Lords and then you can come back to this Court and ask, first of all, for us to certify that question as being of general public importance, and, secondly, to ask for leave to appeal to the House of Lords. If we certify it as being of general public importance and refuse leave, you can then seek leave from the House of Lords itself, Mr Kelleher. Now, it is really very important that you try to get a question drafted in the sort of form which the Court considers sensible. You have --
62.
THE APPELLANT: I don't consider this Court sensible, my Lord.
63.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: There is no need to be rude.
64.
THE APPELLANT: My Lord, I am not trying to be rude. I have the utmost respect for the Court. This Court has the best customer service I have ever seen in this Court, my Lord. It is beyond -- I am humbled by the customer service, but I don't mean to be rude at all, my Lord.
65.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: You don't agree with the judgment, Mr Kelleher.
66.
THE APPELLANT: Of course I don't, my Lord.
67.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: That is your privilege.
68.
THE APPELLANT: But, my Lord, it's in your opinion then that Lord Aikens was wrong?
69.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: I am not answering questions, Mr Kelleher. I am advising you as to your next course.
70.
THE APPELLANT: On 16th September 2002 in Lord Aikens' court universal law was declared. That was binding. That is effective law and it is binding now.
71.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: You have heard what I said, Mr Kelleher, please be quiet for a moment. You've heard what I have said. If you want to take the matter further then you have to follow the procedure which we have indicated. Now you may think it sensible to try to get the help of Miss Humphreys who represented you in drafting a question which you think is suitable for consideration by the House of Lords.
72.
THE APPELLANT: But the House of Lords don't understand, my Lord, that respect, trust, peace, care, family, faith, hope and happiness.
73.
LORD JUSTICE MANTELL: Mr Kelleher, that's all I intend to say to you. The Court will rise.
74.
THE APPELLANT: I didn't mean to offend you, my Lord.

The cricket bat proving ineffectual, Mr Kelleher took hold of a metal stanchion, which supported the cordon round the statue, and with that was able to achieve his purpose.  We understand that the statue was damaged beyond repair and will cost £150,000 to replace.  20.Copy link to this paragraph Having done what he set out to do, Mr Kelleher calmly awaited the arrival of the police.  To them he explained his philosophy and his motives.  At one point he said, ""I fear genuinely for the future of my son.  I don't believe he has a very rosy outlook to life"".  He made it plain that in acting as he did he was seeking publicity for his views in the hope that, if accepted by others, they might bring about improvements in the world situation.  21.Copy link to this paragraph He was charged with criminal damage.  In the first instance he stood trial at Southwark Crown Court before Aikens J and a jury.  He represented himself.  None of the Crown's evidence was in dispute and all of it was read.  In his defence Mr Kelleher read from a prepared statement in the course of which he once again explained his philosophy and his motives.  This passage occurs:

November 2015
THE VICE PRESIDENT:
1. Since
section 240
A of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
(introduced by
section 21
of the
Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008
) came into force in November 2008, it has been necessary for the sentencing court to specify the number of days that will count towards sentence in consequence of time spent on remand subject to a qualifying curfew.
2. Despite the court's best endeavours, guidance in
R Hoggard
[2013] EWCA Crim 1024
, [2014] 1 Cr App R(S) 42, as to the procedure to be adopted in the Crown Court, and additional guidance in
R v Thorsby and Others
[2015] EWCA Crim 1
, as to the procedure to be adopted in this court, is being ignored. Hence this Special Court has been convened today so as to re-affirm and re-emphasise the relevant principles.
Procedure in the Magistrates / Crown Court
3. So as to ensure that the court has the fullest possible information, any court imposing a curfew with a tagging condition should use the relevant form (the record of electronic monitoring of curfew). The form should be included with the case papers and accompany them wherever the case is sent. At any subsequent sentencing hearing solicitors and/or counsel for the defendant should ask him whether he has been subject to curfew and tagging. If he says that he has, they should ascertain the details. It is also the duty of the Crown Prosecution Service to have in place a system to assist the court. The parties should then be in a position to inform the court of any issue as to time spent on a qualifying curfew.
4. With the necessary information to hand the sentencing court must take the following steps:
Step1
: Add up the days spent on qualifying curfew including the first, but not the last, if on the last day the defendant was taken into custody.
Step 2
: Deduct the days on which the defendant was at the same time also (i) being monitored with a tag for compliance with a curfew requirement and/or (ii) on temporary release from custody.
Step 3
: Deduct the days when the defendant has broken the curfew or the tagging condition.
Step 4
: Divide the result by 2.
Step 5
: If necessary, round up to the nearest whole number.
5. To avoid difficulties the court in
Hoggard
helpfully provided a form of words for sentencers to use:
""The defendant will receive full credit for half the time spent under curfew if the curfew qualified under the provisions of
section 240
A. On the information before me the total period is ... days (subject to the deduct of ... days that I have directed under the Step(s) 2 and/or 3 making a total of ... days), but if this period is mistaken, this court will order an amendment of the record for the correct period to be recorded.""
6.
Advocates should be on the alert so that if the judge fails to use these words, they can raise the issue with him or her. If the judge does not use these words, and no one realises at the hearing, defence representatives should use their best endeavours to have the case re-listed within 56 days under the slip rule. We understand from Mr Heptonstall, who prosecuted before us today, that in most cases prisoners are informed of their sentence calculation within seven days of sentence and should be in a position to advise their representatives of any error in good time.
7.
If the
Hoggard
formula is not used, and the 56 days have expired by the time anyone realises that an error has been made, an application must be made to this court.
8.
If the
Hoggard
formula is used the Crown Court thereby retains jurisdiction of the matter, even after 56 days. If any amendment needs to be made it can be made administratively, provided the parties agree. We advise caution in allowing an administrative correction of the direction where the amount of time a defendant will spend in custody is significantly affected. The judge will wish to satisfy him/herself that the calculations are correct.
9.
If the parties are not agreed, the court must decide. If a judge decides that it would be a disproportionate use of court time and incur unnecessary expense to hold a hearing, the issue can be resolved on the papers in the defendant's favour.
The Procedure in the Court of Appeal
10. For present purposes the two relevant paragraphs of
Thorsby
are paragraphs 28 and 29. An applicant who applies for leave to appeal will be expected to attach to his application either his agreement with the prosecution as to the number of days credit, or the relevant documentation to support his assertion that he is entitled to X days' credit under
section 240
A. It is the responsibility of the applicant's representatives, not the Court of Appeal Office, to make enquiries with the lower court and the monitoring company, and then seek the agreement of the prosecution. The applicant must then state that the calculation is agreed, or identify the nature and extent of any dispute. The court expects the Crown Prosecution Service to investigate as a matter of urgency and at a sufficiently high level.
11. Applicants (or their lawyers) will be expected to provide a witness statement explaining when and how they became aware of an error in the court's calculations or order. There should be no further unnecessary delay.
12. The advice in
Thorsby
could not be clearer; yet still applications are being lodged without agreement from the Crown on the number of days spent on qualifying curfew, and with no accompanying statement from the applicant's solicitor setting out why an extension of time should be granted. They are being lodged late, so that they demand an urgent response from the Court of Appeal Office. Further, some local Crown Prosecution Units are not responding to requests from the defence solicitors for an agreement. As a result, the Court of Appeal Office is spending a disproportionate amount of time and resources on correcting errors.
13. In future, if the requirements in
Thorsby
have not been complied with, the Criminal Appeal Office will no longer progress applications on behalf of represented applicants. The Registrar will notify the applicant's solicitor of the duty to comply with
Thorsby
before anything can happen. The CPS Appeals Unit has undertaken to assess the number of days. If the calculations are agreed, the single judge will be able to give leave and send the mater to the full court for a formal declaration without any need for representation. If the calculations are not agreed, the single judge may prefer simply to refer the matter to the full court for resolution, without giving leave or making a representation order. If the Registrar is satisfied that the Crown Court has used the appropriate words, allowing them to amend the days administratively, he will notify the parties that the Crown Court retains jurisdiction and that initially he intends to treat the application as ineffective. The applicant can then ask the Crown Court to re-list the matter and resolve the issue.
14. Practitioners must appreciate that they have a duty to comply with the court's requirements. If they continue to ignore those requirements there may come a time when, in the case of serious misconduct, the court will be forced to report any offender to their professional body for a failure to comply with their professional obligations and/or consider making a costs order. The liberty of the subject is at stake and this issue is not to be taken lightly.
15. We turn to the facts of the individual cases.
R v Christopher Ramos
16. On 7
th
April 2014 the applicant (who was disqualified from driving), took a valuable Mercedes without consent. He drove without insurance. The car was traced and police tried to stop the vehicle. The applicant drove dangerously at speeds between 30 and 80mph in a built-up area, pursued by police cars and a helicopter. He caused a moped driver to crash and to sustain injury. Following his arrest he was released on bail with a qualifying curfew.
17. On 3
rd
July 2014 he was seen driving a van. He reversed at speeds in excess of 50 to 60mph, knocking over several bins and crashing into a Citroen car, causing it to mount a pavement and hit another car. Police officers on foot waved their arms to try to get the applicant to stop. He drove towards them, causing them to move out of the way, and he then drove off. The van was later found abandoned. The applicant then failed to comply with his bail conditions in respect of his tagged curfew and effectively went on the run.
18. On 23
rd
July 2014 he was arrested. On 25
th
July he was remanded in custody for other matters.
19. On 6
th
January 2015 he pleaded guilty to various offences and was sentenced to a total of two years and three months' imprisonment. On 28
th
April 2015 an application for leave to appeal against sentence was received in the Court of Appeal Office, accompanied by a short Advice from the applicant's legal representative, Mr Sharma, simply setting out dates of the time on curfew and amount of credit allegedly due.
20. The Court of Appeal Office was forced to conduct its own inquiries. On 7
th
May 2015 it requested bail documents and other relevant documents from Croydon Crown Court. The Registrar then directed that the applicant's solicitor must lodge a statement and agree the number of days with the prosecution, pursuant to the judgment in
Thorsby
.
21. On 26
th
May 2015 the matter was re-listed before the Crown Court. No one has accepted responsibility for the listing. Mr Sharma appeared for the applicant. He invited the sentencing Judge to direct that time spent on qualifying curfew should count towards the sentence. The Judge questioned whether she had the power, given that this was outside the slip rule. Mr Sharma informed her, wrongly, that the Court of Appeal had refused to deal with the matter and had sent it back to the Crown Court. He claimed that he had telephoned the office and had received no response to his inquiries. Miss Milson, who appeared for the Crown, in the belief that the Court of Appeal had refused to deal with the matter, agreed that the Crown Court Judge must have jurisdiction. The Judge asserted several times that she would only act on the basis that the matter had been sent back to her by this court. She then purported to give a direction that the advocates invited her to do: she directed that 54 days spent on a qualifying curfew should count towards the sentence (this being half of the 108 days that the applicant was said to have spent on curfew).
22. In July 2015 the applicant was released. The same month Mr Sharma confirmed by email that the sentence had been amended by the Crown Court. On 7
th
September 2015 the Registrar referred the application for leave to the full court and directed that Mr Sharma provide an explanation to the court as to how the matter came to be re-listed.
23. In a witness statement dated 21
st
September 2015, Mr Sharma provided a similar explanation to that he had given to the Crown Court Judge: that he had understood that the matter was to be heard in the Court of Appeal, but that he had obtained no response from the Court of Appeal Office and therefore assumed that somehow the matter had been re-listed at the Crown Court as a result of a Court of Appeal decision.
24. The court directed that Mr Sharma should attend, because this explanation was not considered adequate. Mr Sharma did not respond to that direction, and therefore the court had to issue a witness order. He attended before us this morning. He accepted that we should not have been forced to issue a witness order and he apologised for the way in which he had conducted aspects of the case. He assured us that he had not deliberately misled the court or failed in his duty. However, when pressed, he was forced to concede that his choice of words on 26
th
May may have had misled the court and the prosecutor. Further, we now know that his calculations were wrong.
25. The Crown Court had no jurisdiction to make a direction under
section 240
A outside the 56 days allowed for the slip rule, and in the absence of the form of words used in
Thorsby
. Had the advocates at the sentencing hearing raised the issue, and had these words been used, this hearing would not have been necessary. Considerable time and effort have gone into preparing the case for us; time and effort better spent elsewhere. However, having heard from Mr Sharma this morning, we have decided on this occasion to make no further order as far as costs are concerned.
26. We are left in the position that the applicant was entitled to credit for no more than one-half of 85 days – not 108. The unlawful order has resulted in his early release from prison and he has benefitted from an additional 12 days' credit.
27. Mr Heptonstall, in his customary helpful submissions, has considered and rejected a number of options. There remain two. One would involve giving leave, quashing the order and substituting the new figure of 43 days. This would mean the applicant having to return to prison and, arguably, would be beyond our powers, falling foul of
section 11(3)
of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
.
Section 11(3)
provides that this court cannot pass a sentence that would result in a harsher sentence overall. The other option would involve giving leave, quashing the direction made by the judge and substituting for it a figure that would not lead to the applicant's return to prison.
28. Given the circumstances, in our judgment it would be disproportionate and wrong to pursue this matter any further. We shall determine the issue in the applicant's favour.
29. Accordingly, we give leave. We allow the appeal and we substitute a lawful direction under
section 240
A for one-half of 108 days, namely 54 days. For the avoidance of doubt, we shall use the words in
Hoggard
: the appellant (as he now is) will receive full credit for half the time spent under curfew because the curfew qualified under the provisions of
section 240
A. On the information before us the total period is 108 days, but if this period is mistaken, this court will order an amendment of the record for the correct period to be recorded.
30. We should add that the application for leave to appeal against sentence was far too optimistic. There was nothing excessive about the total sentence in the light of the repeated and serious nature of the applicant's offending.
R v Raymond Martin Marshall
31. Marshall faced different sets of charges and this led to confusion. The first set of charges stemmed from October 2007, when he was charged and remanded into custody. In April 2008 he was bailed with a qualifying curfew. In November 2008,
section 240
A came into force. In January 2009 there was a hearing. There was then a second set of charges. In June 2010 he was charged and remanded into custody. In June 2011 he was bailed with a qualifying curfew on both cases which were later joined. In March 2012 the curfew condition was removed.
32. On 7
th
August 2013 Marshall was convicted of a single count of possession with intent to supply cocaine. He was surprisingly bailed yet again until sentence with a qualifying curfew.
33. On 20
th
September 2013 he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The judge directed that credit be given for ten days spent on remand on custody and whilst on qualifying tagged curfew. The record of qualifying curfew runs on to 25
th
September. There seems to have been a failure to inform the monitoring company to cancel the tag. Pursuant to this order credit was initially given for 553 days of tagged curfew. By order of 19
th
November 2013 His Honour Judge Parker QC, acting on information provided by the monitoring company Serco, directed that the number of days should be reduced to 159.
34. Marshall has been granted leave to appeal against sentence limited to the calculation under
section 240
A. It is said that insufficient credit was given for days spent on tagged curfew between April 2008 and November 2008 (period one), and after 3
rd
November 2008 (period two). The difference is significant: 264 effective days.
35. The single judge Warby J has dealt with the application in an extremely helpful manner. The application first came before him in May 2015, at which time it was wholly unclear how many days had been spent on tagged curfew. He gave directions for the applicant and the prosecution to address the matter. As a result, the Crown Prosecution Service investigated and, by a letter dated 2
nd
June 2015, provided a schedule of the days spent on tagged curfew. It became apparent that the appellant had not been given sufficient credit.
36. In this case the judge did use the form of words set out in
Thorsby
and the sentence could be amended administratively. However, the figures were not agreed. Not surprisingly, the appellant maintains that he should have been given the opportunity to address the court on an issue that materially affected his sentence.
37. There can be no doubt that the court had the power to reduce the number of days: see
R v Leacock
[2013] EWCA Crim 1994
. However, in
Leacock
there was no real dispute that Leacock would not ordinarily have been entitled to the days.
38. As we have already indicated, where there is a dispute as to the days that should be allowed, particularly where it would materially affect somebody's sentence, the Crown Court should offer the defence the opportunity to be heard. In this case we have no doubt that had His Honour Judge Parker been alerted to the fact that there was a dispute, he would have called for submissions from the defence.
39. We cannot now ascertain exactly what has happened, because tape-recordings of various hearings have been destroyed. That is an example of why it is important to address these issues at the time of sentence. It looks as if the appellant was made subject to a qualifying curfew, but the tagging equipment was removed in error and not replaced until 2011.
40. The requirements of
section 240
A apply where the offender's bail is ""subject to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition"". In this case the appellant was subject at all relevant times to a qualifying curfew condition and an electronic monitoring condition. The fact that there was an administrative error and the court's order was not implemented does not alter the fact that he was subject to a qualifying curfew. He must receive the credit.
41. The appellant is therefore entitled to 456 days credit. Again, using the words in
Hoggard
, he will receive full credit on the information before us for the total period of 456 days, but if this period is mistaken, the court will order an amendment of the record for the correct period to be recorded.
R v Saraj Mahmood Hussain
42. This case is much more straightforward, thanks to Mr Heptonstall's diligence. On 24
th
October 2014 at the Burnley Crown Court the applicant was convicted of robbery and fraud. On 28
th
January 2015 he was sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment.
43. The advocates failed to draw to the Recorder's attention the fact that at the time of sentence he had been subject to a qualifying curfew condition. This was an oversight on their part. The applicant only recently become aware of the position and drew it immediately to the attention of his solicitors. His applications for an extension of time of 166 days and for leave to appeal were referred directly to this court.
44. Mr Heptonstall apologised for the prosecution’s part in the error and for the fact that this application has been required. He confirmed that Hussain was subject to a qualifying curfew for a period of 96 days. There were 14 recorded breaches of relatively short duration, Mr Heptonstall did not seek to persuade us to embark upon a factual resolution of how much reduction should be made for those breaches on the basis it would be disproportionate. He agreed that the number of days for which Hussain should be credited is 48.
45. Again, we give leave and using the words in
Hoggard
, on the information before us the total period that we credit under
section 240
A is 48 days, but if this period is mistaken the court will order an amendment to the record for the correct period to be recorded.
46. To that extent, where necessary, leave is granted, the appeals are allowed and amendments to the directions are made in each case.","citation:

1.
MR JUSTICE FORBES: On 22nd December 2005, at the Southwark Crown Court, this appellant was convicted, following a trial, of an offence of possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to
section 58(1)(b)
of the
Terrorism Act 2000
. On 26th January 2006 he was sentenced to 6 years' imprisonment. The judge directed that the period the appellant had spent on remand in custody was to count towards his sentence, and made an order for the forfeiture and disposal of a gun under
section 52 of the Firearms Act 1968
. The appellant now appeals against that sentence by leave of the Single Judge.
2.
A brief outline of the facts is as follows. In the early hours of the morning of 24th March 2005, officers from the Anti Terrorist Squad and Firearms Squad raided the flat in Woolwich, South East London, where the appellant was living. The appellant was arrested and the flat was searched. Officers found a number of documents in a bag belonging to the appellant. The first of those documents was a newspaper article about a soldier who had been decorated for gallantry in Iraq. It appeared that someone had researched the basic details contained in the article to the effect that the soldier came from Portsmouth in Hampshire. On a separate sheet of paper found in the same bag the appellant had written down the soldier's name and full address. In fact, the soldier had lived at that address with his partner until June 2002, but had then moved away. At the time of the search of the appellant's flat, therefore, the soldier was no longer resident at the address recorded on the sheet of paper although he had been resident there some time before.
3.
How the information concerning the address had been obtained is unknown. But it is obvious that someone had made the relevant research to enable the appellant to write down the address in question. An A4 refill pad was also recovered and forensically examined. From the indentations on the pad it was established that the appellant had written away for information concerning two prominent Jewish men and two prominent Hindu businessmen. The officers also found a number of DVDs containing anti-western propaganda, Islamic propaganda praising martyrdom, others giving details of suicide car bombings against the British and against the Russians in Chechnya and yet others showing the aftermath of a suicide bombing and the like.
4.
A dismantled pistol was also recovered. It was a pistol designed for firing blanks modelled on a Beretta self-loading pistol. However it was incapable of discharging a bullet, although examination revealed that an attempt had been made to bore out the dummy barrel and convert it into a working firearm.
5.
An eavesdropping device, a scanner and a Balaclava with cut out eyes were also found at the flat.
6.
When interviewed the appellant refused to answer questions but made several prepared statements in which he stated that he had nothing to do with terrorism, that he had no strong political views and that he was not a strict practising Muslim. He stated that he had purchased the dismantled pistol at a market stall for £25 to have as a souvenir, that he rented the flat from a friend and that several of his friends had access to the flat. He claimed some of the DVDs were his and that others belonged to his friends.
7.
When passing sentence the judge said this (inter alia):
""The maximum sentence for this offence is 10 years' imprisonment. You have never faced a charge of conspiracy to kill or cause harm and I do not sentence you for that, but when that information came into your possession and was recorded by you, you crossed the boundary into terrorism, and the other items found in your flat; the horrific DVDs and the imitation firearm that someone had tried to convert, confirmed that.
Any body who crosses that line and commits a terrorist offence must know that if convicted they will face a substantial sentence. In your case I take into account your limited intelligence and I have no doubt that others must have played a significant part in what took place and, in fact, nothing had yet happened.
The sentence of the court is one of 6 years' imprisonment.""
8.
The appellant is now aged 22. He has one previous conviction for affray in the Thames Magistrates' Court for which he was conditionally discharged for 12 months on 8th May 2002. There were two psychological reports before the court, the first was from Dr Robert Epstein, dated 12th August 2005. In his report Dr Epstein concluded that the appellant had a learning disability, marked by poor overall intelligence, a directionless and irresponsible life-style and major adaptive behaviour defects. According to Dr Epstein the appellant's self reported history revealed difficulties in school, long periods of truancy, poor employment and conflict with his father, all of which would be consistent with frustration and poor ability to adapt to the necessities and responsibilities of everyday life. The second psychological report and had been prepared by Professor Gisli Gudjonsson and was dated 17th September 2005. Professor Gudjonsson concluded that the appellant's intelligence fell within the borderline range of intellectual disability, ie about the bottom 2 per cent of the population. However, Professor Gudjonsson concluded that the appellant was not unduly suggestible. In the course of his oral evidence before the court, when presented with other documentary material Professor Gudjonsson maintained the conclusions that he had expressed in his report.
9.
There was also a pre-sentence report, dated 23rd January 2006. In it the probation officer expressed the opinion that there appeared to be a low risk of the appellant re-offending, but a medium risk of harm to the public.
10.
On behalf of the appellant, Mr Carter-Manning QC submitted that the sentence passed was manifestly excessive. He contended that insufficient account had been taken of the appellant's youth, the low level of his educational abilities and intelligence, his role as a follower rather than a leader and the fact that no approach of any kind had been shown to have been made to either the soldier to or to any of the other persons about whom enquiries had apparently been made. Mr Carter-Manning also referred to the case of the notorious cleric Abu Hamza. Mr Carter-Manning submitted that Abu Hamza's case was a very much more serious case involving the commission of offences under the same Act. It was Mr Carter-Manning's submissions that a difference of only one year was insufficient to distinguish between the two cases, having regard to the difference in the level of seriousness of the criminality involved in the two cases.
11.
We have considered these submissions with great care. We note that the maximum sentence available for this offence was one of 10 years' imprisonment. However, we are not persuaded that any useful comparison can be made between this case and that involving Abu Hamza. In our view the judge was entirely right to have regard, as he did, to all the relevant facts and circumstances relating to this particular case and to this particular appellant. As the judge observed when passing sentence, the jury's verdict established that the appellant had committed a terrorist offence. We agree with the judge that a person convicted of a terrorist offence must expect a substantial sentence to be imposed by the court. The court must impose such a sentence in order to serve as a deterrent to others and to mark the extreme seriousness of the criminality involved in terrorist activities. In our view, the law abiding public is entitled to expect no less. In this case, the judge took into account all the relevant factors, including the appellant's limited intelligence, and passed a sentence that was, in our judgment, within the range that was appropriate in all the circumstances. In our view, the sentence passed by the judge certainly cannot properly be stigmatised as manifestly excessive. Accordingly for all those reasons this appeal against sentence is dismissed.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE MAY: It was 28 years ago, on 2nd October 1978, that David Hempston, the appellant, was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and an offence under
section 21
of
the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
, particularised as choking, suffocating or strangling a woman with intent to disinhibit her.
2.
Since the early eighties he has been detained, not in prison, but in a number of secure hospitals, as we understand it upon the direction of the Secretary of State under
section 47
of the
Mental Health Act 1983
, as it now is. The equivalent statute in force at the time of his sentence was the
Mental Health Act 1959
. It is not suggested that there is any material difference between the provisions of those two statutes centrally relevant to this appeal.
3.
He is so detained because he is mentally ill. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. The opinion is that he remains a risk to others, especially women.
4.
The present appeal is on a Reference from the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The basis of the Reference is that, if medical opinions now available had been available to the sentencing judge, the judge would have been in a position and under a duty to have imposed a Hospital Order under what is now
section 37
of the
Mental Health Act 1983
, together with a restriction order under section 41, without limitation of time, instead of a sentence of life imprisonment.
5.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission considered that there is a real possibility that this Court would allow the appeal and substitute a Hospital Order.
6.
The formal conditions for a Hospital Order and a restriction order are fulfilled. The appellant is suffering from mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia, and there is written and oral evidence of two registered medical practitioners to that effect. Their view is that it is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment. A bed is, on the evidence, available for him within 28 days (plainly so, because, as we understand it, he is there occupying it already). If a Hospital Order is to be made, the opinion is that there is a serious risk that he would commit further offences if he is released, so that a restriction order is necessary and appropriate. None of this is contentious.
7.
It may be asked what difference would it make, since all the present indications are that the appellant will have to continue to be detained for some time. The short answers to this include that a Hospital Order has less stigma than a sentence of life imprisonment; that practical circumstances regarding the possibility of future release are more onerous if the appellant then had to return to prison first; but significantly, that it is the Parole Board which considers release if the appellant is a prisoner, but the Mental Health Tribunal if he is a patient.
8.
Procedures and approaches of these two bodies are very broadly similar. Each would be centrally concerned with whether the appellant remains or is at risk of being a danger to the public, particularly in this appellant's case to women. But the emphasis of the Parole Board is perhaps upon protection of the public, whereas the Mental Health Review Tribunal is as concerned with managing the patient's mental health. Miss Tayton submits that a discretionary life sentence affords greater protection for the public than a Hospital Order.
9.
We have heard oral evidence today from two of the psychiatric doctors, to the effect, at least in Dr Exworthy's case, that the procedures for possible future release under a Hospital Order would be such as to provide protection for the public.
10.
So it is that the main issue before the Court today is whether, in the words of
section 37(2)
(b) of the
Mental Health Act 1983
, the Court is of the opinion, having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character and antecedent of the offender, and to other available methods of dealing with him, that a Hospital Order is the most suitable method of disposing the case by means of an order under
section 37
.
11.
Mr Taylor, for the appellant, says that it is; that it would have been the right order to make in 1978 if the judge had had the additional evidence now before Court; and that if the criteria for a hospital are fulfilled, it is the order which should normally be made in preference to a determinate sentence or one of life imprisonment. He says that there does not have to be a causal link between the mental illness and the offending, a proposition with which Miss Tayton does not disagree. He also says that the judge was wrong to refuse, as he did, an application for an adjournment to obtain further psychiatric evidence. Miss Tayton, in an economic and sensitively understated submission, submits that the application of the leading House of Lords authority in R v Drew
[2003] UKHL 25
, [2003] 2 Cr App R(S) 24, suggests that, in the present case, the discretionary life sentence should not be replaced with a Hospital Order and a restriction order.
12.
Before proceeding to the details of this appeal, we should clear away some undergrowth. First, there is an unopposed application to admit fresh evidence of reports by Dr Exworthy and Dr Nimmagadda. There is also a very recent psychiatric report of Dr Cree, the appellant's present responsible medical officer, proffered to satisfy the two registered medical practitioner's requirement of
sections 37
and 41. In fact we now have, and are grateful for it, three registered medical practitioners. We admit that evidence and have heard two of the doctors give evidence orally.
13.
Secondly, we are not assisted, neither is the appeal strengthened, by a debate about whether the judge was right or wrong to refuse an adjournment 28 years ago for further psychiatric evidence. We can see the force of that submission. But the real question is whether, on the psychiatric evidence now available and in the light of what has happened with the appellant since 1978, the court in 1978 would and should have made a Hospital Order with a restriction order. In the light of the new evidence, it is agreed that that is a question for this Court to consider on the totality of the evidence and that we are not concerned with the now academic question of whether the judge, 28 years ago, was manifestly wrong on material that he had.
14.
It is now necessary to go into some detail. The appellant pleaded guilty in the Central Criminal Court on 2nd October 1978 before His Honour the late Judge Argyle QC, who sentenced to him to the following terms of imprisonment: for one count of rape, life imprisonment; for one count of attempting to render a person incapable of resistance with intent, contrary to
section 21
of
the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
, life imprisonment; for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 4 years' imprisonment; for burglary with intent to rape, 2 years' imprisonment; for common assault, 9 months' imprisonment; for common assault originally charged as assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 6 months' imprisonment; and for a further count of common assault, 1 months' imprisonment, all those doubtless being imposed concurrently.
15.
Surprisingly there is a transcript of the proceedings in 1978, including the judge's sentencing remarks.
16.
On 9th October 1980 the Single Judge refused the appellant's original application for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence. The application was renewed before the Full Court and refused on 22nd January 1981.
17.
The facts, which if everyone will excuse us, we shall take rather quickly, were as follows. The appellant was 30 years old at the time of the offences and by reason of his psychiatric history was familiar with the layout of Kingston Hospital. The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.
18.
Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.
19.
Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.
20.
Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught.
21.
On examination, she was frightened and distressed. The doctor did not find any marks of violence on her body but concluded that she would have been incapable of resisting an active muscular male.
22.
Counts 6 and 7, attempting to render someone incapable of resistance with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm: on 1st January 1978, a 21 year old woman called Miss G had been to a nightclub in North London and was returning home alone at about 1.30 am by thumbing a lift. She was picked up by the appellant who was driving a van. She noticed that the appellant was shaking continuously and asked to get out. The vehicle was moving and the appellant said, in a fierce voice: ""No, you stop in here."" She tried to open the door but the appellant grabbed both her wrists with one hand and held her tightly. He drove to a dark street in the Victoria area and started to kiss her. She began to scream. The appellant tried to suppress her screams by putting both hands round her throat and he kept pressing to such an extent that she fainted from the pressure being applied. A female passerby was suspicious of the activity in the van and upon closer inspection saw a girl struggling with a man. She opened the passenger door and asked what was going on. This seemed to surprise the appellant, who let go of Miss G who managed to escape from the van. The appellant drove away. The passerby made a note of his registration number and called the police who traced the appellant from the registration number.
23.
When he was interviewed, having been arrested, the appellant made two statements under caution, a brief summary of them included the following. Firstly, his mother had suffered a nervous breakdown when he was 2 years old and had been in a psychiatric hospital since. She had tuberculosis and the appellant contracted it when he was 5 years old. He must take after his mother because all his life he had had problems and treatment for his nerves. He had received psychiatric treatment at Kingston Hospital since he was 15 years old. However he had not been to the hospital since he was about 19, because after about 3 years he had decided they were not advanced enough in that field to treat him. His mental state had started to deteriorate about 18 months previously, when the relationship with his girlfriend ended. He made admissions to the various offences. He described himself as possessed. He did not know what he was doing. He said: ""I need help to help me get my life sorted out"". It is, of course, and remains to his credit that he pleaded guilty to all these offences.
24.
Before sentencing, counsel sought further psychiatric examinations of the appellant, to find out exactly what condition he was in and whether he should be punished or whether the court would consider making an order under the
Mental Health Act 1959
. The judge indicated that on the medical evidence already before him he took the view that there was no opening under the Mental Health Act. The judge stated:
""I would willingly consider a Section 60 Order with a Section 65 restriction, but there is very strong evidence that that course is not really open.""
That was a reference to one or both of the psychiatric reports that were before the court at the time, which did not appear to encourage the judge to make a hospital order. Later, the judge said to counsel, Mr Herbert, who was in court mitigating on behalf of the appellant, that it seemed to him that he had better address the court on the basis that the appellant had got to be sent to prison for a very long time. There was medical evidence before the court which told the judge, in his view, in very plain terms, that this was not a medical case. The judge commented that if the appellant became a medical case once in custody, then he could be transferred administratively by the Home Office. Therefore he would not adjourn for further medical enquiries as the judge was satisfied that if a mental condition did arise, the authorities would deal with it.
25.
The two medical reports which were before the sentencing judge were a report dated 28th June 1978 from Dr Bearcroft and a report dated 31st July 1978 from a Dr Clark.
26.
In passing sentence, Judge Argyle said that the court had given careful consideration to the medical aspects of the appellant's history in the case, but up-to-date medical reports said that he was not eligible for treatment at the present time under the Mental Health Act. Taken into account were his guilty plea, for which he very much commended, and that he was virtually a man of previous good character. Protection of the public, in particular nurses at this hospital, was a major consideration. The judge felt obliged to pass an indeterminate sentence to enable the Home Office authorities and Health Service to determine when it would be safe to allow him his liberty. In the meantime the victims and any potential victims had to be given reassurance. At a later stage, when the judge was asked to comment on the possibility of the appellant's release, he expressed his view in forceful terms that he should not be released.
27.
There is inevitably over the intervening years a large amount of psychiatric and historical material about what has happened to the appellant. His behaviour initially deteriorated and became increasingly odd during the early part of his life sentence according to a report by Dr Stewart the prison medical officer in July 1979. He said that by April 1979 the appellant was clearly psychotic and recommended a transfer to hospital. He was transferred to the prison hospital wing. In April 1979 Dr Stewart asked Broadmoor Hospital to assess the appellant, stating that the offence appears to have been the result of his illness. But for his good response to treatment while on remand it is likely that he would have been dealt with under
section 60
to 65 of
the 1959 Act
and had been ""in your care"", that is to say Broadmoor Hospital, some time ago. As a result, the appellant was examined by Dr Le Couteur, who concluded that he was mentally ill and required hospitalisation.
28.
Dr Faulk also examined the appellant and supported the recommendation for a transfer to hospital, opining that he suffered from schizophrenia. He noted suggestions of mental abnormality in the appellant's statements to the police. He was first transferred to Broadmoor on 3rd January 1980. There were no signs of mental illness on examination and whilst he was tense and anxious he was not psychotic. By examination on 27th March 1980, he had received no treatment or medication, was not in need of medical treatment and therefore he was returned to prison. However, on return to prison his behaviour was noted as being rather odd. Broadmoor reassessed him but did not think he warranted hospitalisation. He was treated with anti-psychotic medication in February 1981 and he attempted suicide on 1st January 1982. He was assessed by Dr Mawson from Broadmoor, who believed he was suffering from chronic schizophrenia. He was transferred back to Broadmoor on 12th February 1982 and treated with antidepressants which improved his condition. Whilst still there a report by Dr Gordon in April 1984 diagnosed the appellant as suffering chronic schizophrenia with a prominent depressive component, and said that he should not be returned to prison at that stage. After no evidence of a relapse for 10 months his medication was stopped in September 1985, but he deteriorated again and was placed back on the medication in March 1986. In November 1986 he became acutely psychotic and further medication was administered. He initially improved but relapsed in June 1987. His state improved on high doses of anti-psychotic medication between 1988 and 1989, although there remained a strangeness and bizarreness in his behaviour. It was felt that his personality had been seriously damaged by his schizophrenic illness.
29.
In December 1991, whilst still in Broadmoor, he was examined by Dr Adshead, who agreed that he suffered from a schizo-affective disorder. She added that the fact that he was fairly consistently ill whilst on remand suggested to her that he was probably psychotic and at least prodromal at the time of the offence. The diagnosis was reaffirmed by Dr Halstead in a report in September 1995.
30.
A case conference in October 1993 recorded signs of psychosis being present. In May 1994 Dr McQuaid opined that the appellant was suffering from schizophrenia with a marked affective component. He believed the appellant had been mentally ill at the time of the offences and psychotic symptoms were still present at the time of interview. Dr Minne also concluded he was suffering from schizo-affective disorder and medication was controlling the acute symptoms.
31.
Case conference notes in November 1995 summarised the major issues as including chronic psychosis and organic contribution, heavy drinking before the offence and his suicide attempt requiring resuscitation, difficulties in engaging in psychotherapy and concrete thinking in relation to the offence.
32.
At a case conference in July 1997 the report written by Dr Adshead concluded that the appellant's mental state had been deteriorating for a number of years before he committed the offence. The fact that he was psychotic on remand suggested that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence. The most likely diagnoses seemed to be schizo-affective disorder with predominantly depressive features. However, given his psychological profile and his consistent minimisation and denial of the offences, it was likely that his attitude to women and his views about rape contributed as much to the offence as mental illness. His mental illness had been treated since his detention and that aspect had been addressed. What remained was his attitudes to women and rape, which continued to give concern.
33.
In August 1997 a report by Dr Lack concluded that the appellant was suffering from a schizo-affective disorder. It stated that given that the appellant first described psychiatric symptoms at the age of 17, his personality development had been severely affected by his illness. The difficulties he experienced in his attachment to others within the family, his poor social skills and misuse of alcohol were all relevant contributory factors to the offence. She also noted the possibility of organic brain damage and similar concern over his attitude to the offences.
34.
A pre-discharge report from Broadmoor, dated 10th August 1999, stated it was obvious that the appellant had had a long-standing mental illness and had become a chronic psychotic with evidence of intellectual impairment and institutionalisation. He did not have full insight and presented a significant degree of risk. It was decided he no longer needed a high secure environment and would be transferred to the medium secure Thornford Park. His attitude and behaviour towards women should be monitored and ongoing treatment was required for a long time.
35.
So, the appellant was admitted to Thornford Park on 25th August 1999. A report by Dr Dontchev, dated 4th October 2001, stated that after appearing to settle well his mental state deteriorated at the end of 2000, in that he appeared psychotic with bizarre and delusional ideas. He was seen staring at some of the female nurses. He did not feel that he was ill or needed medication but agreed to take it.
36.
So that is the psychiatric history in the brief of the 28 years since the appellant was sentenced.
37.
Before the Court today, as fresh evidence, are two reports from Dr Exworthy, one dated 10th February 2004 and the other 30th August 2005; a report from Dr Nimmagadda, dated 15th September 2005 and an updating short report (written least week) dated 25th October 2006.
38.
These reports, taken together with the other material to which we have briefly referred, are put before the Court to show that it was highly likely that the appellant was mentally ill at the time of the offences; that the illness contributed to his offending behaviour, and it is suggested that the appropriate sentence should have been a Hospital Order.
39.
Two passages, quite short, from those reports need to be referred to. The first is from Dr Exworthy first report, where he said (paragraph 6 page 27):
""It is my opinion that there is no direct link between Mr Hempston's schizoaffective disorder and his offences. I have read no entry or opinion in psychiatric reports which stated or implied he had offended because of or on the basis of specific psychotic symptoms; for example acting on the basis of delusional beliefs or in response to auditory hallucinations.
However, I believe it is likely that an indirect link between the illness and offences existed.""
Then in paragraph 14, on page 29:
""However, the significant of Mr Hempston's attitude to women lies in its association with his views on rape and sexual fantasies more generally. This would allow him to minimise, rationalise or even deny his actions in the index offences. In my opinion, these factors are more important than the mental illness in understanding Mr Hempston's offences. Repeated psychosexual assessments have emphasised these factors....
Finally, alcohol appears to have been an important factor in relation to the offence in April 1977.""
Then in Dr Nimmagadda's most recent report he says this:
""Based on the available evidence, it is clear to me that Mr Hempston had a diagnosis of a mental illness most probably schizophrenia for a substantial period, even before he committed his index offence. For the last 29 years subsequent to the committal offence he has been in a secure psychiatric system with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There is also evidence to suggest that he was likely to have been mentally ill at the time of the index offence. Irrespective of whether it has been substantially established or not whether he was acting on the symptoms of his mental illness, I believe his illness was likely to have a bearing on his behaviour at the time of offending. Schizophrenia is a disease of the mind that affects the thinking capacity. It is likely to impair one's judgment and ability to think about the long-term consequences. There was also evidence that he was influence of alcohol at the time of the offences. I believe Mr Hempston's personality characteristics have certainly had a major role in the committal of his offences and his mental illness and alcohol have had likely to have played a contributory role. Although it is difficult to establish the exact extent of the role of his illness on the committal of his offences, on the balance of probabilities, I believe it would have reduced his responsibility for them if he had been charged with murder, I would have considered he had a defence of diminished responsibility.""
40.
Both the doctors have given oral evidence today. Dr Exworthy, in particular, has elaborated upon his opinion by reference to the passages in particular of his first report to which we have just referred.
41.
It is necessary, now, to a refer to a passage in a decision of the House of Lords in a case called R v Drew
[2003] 2 Cr App R 371
which, so far as it goes, is binding on this Court. The Recorder of Cardiff had passed a sentence of life imprisonment and not a Hospital Order. One of the main questions before the House was whether the terms of section 109 of the Powers of Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 providing for life imprisonment offended against the provision of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act. In that context Lord Bingham said in paragraph 17 this:
""It may be accepted that a sentence of life imprisonment, passed under s 109 of the 2000 Act, is, in part at least, punitive in purpose and effect. The minimum term specified by the judge to be served before release is imposed as retribution for the crime committed. It may also be accepted as wrong in principle to punish those who are unfit to be tried or who, although fit to be tried, are not responsible for their conduct because of insanity: see, generally,
R v H [2003] 2 Cr App R(S) 25
.... But the appellant did not claim to be unfit to plead and advanced no defence of insanity. Instead, he pleaded guilty to an offence of which an essential ingredient was an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to another. The Recorder of Cardiff did not regard the appellant as other than criminally culpable. Had he done so he would not have specified a minimum term based on a notional term of eight years. The appellant's mental illness could properly be relied on as mitigating the criminality of this conduct but not as absolving him from all responsibility for it. Mr Davies laid stress on the stigma attaching to a sentence of life imprisonment, which he criticised as unfair in the case of a mentally-disordered defendant such as the appellant. It is of course true that conviction of serious violent crime carries a stigma. But the appellant will have been stigmatised less by the sentence passed upon him than by his voluntary admission of guilt.
Section 82 of the 2000 Act imposes additional duties on sentencing courts where offenders appear to be mentally disordered. Save where a custodial order is fixed by law (as in cases of murder) or falls to be imposed under s 109, the court must consider the offender's mental condition before imposing a custodial sentence. The humanity and fairness of this requirement are obvious. But it cannot, as a matter of national law, be stigmatised as wrong in principle to pass a sentence of imprisonment on a mentally disordered defendant who is criminally responsible and fit to be tried. This is made clear by the terms of
s 37
of
the 1983 Act
, for even where the conditions of subs (2)(a)(i) or (ii) are found to be satisfied the court may make a hospital order only if it is also of opinion under subs (2)(b) that a hospital order is 'the most suitable method of disposing of the case'. If it is not of that opinion, a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed even on an offender in whose case the conditions in subs (2)(a)(i) and (ii) are satisfied. The Court of Appeal in
R v Birch
(1989) 11 Cr App R(S) 202, 215, pointed out that prison might be chosen as an alternative to hospital either because the offender was dangerous and no suitable secure hospital accommodation was available or because there was an element of culpability in the offence which merited punishment, as might happen where there was no connection between the mental disorder and the offence or where the offender's responsibility for the offence was reduced but not wholly extinguished.""
The offence of rape, although not formally characterised as one of intent, has a specific mental element. The rarely charged offence under
section 21
of
the Offence Against the Person Act 1861
, attempting to choke, suffocate or strangle, has a specific statutory intent of the offender enabling himself to commit any indictable offence. Thus, the appellant in the present case was, in a sense, in much the same position as the defendant
Drew. We return to paragraph 17 of Lord Bingham's speech:
""[He] did not claim to be unfit to plead and advanced no defence of insanity. Instead, he pleaded guilty to an offence of which an essential ingredient was an intention to cause grievous bodily harm to another.""
In the present there was a broadly equivalently serious intent. In the present case the judge regarded the appellant as criminally culpable. As we have said, he recommended subsequently that he should never be released.
It is argued here that the appellant's mental illness could properly be relied on in mitigation, but not as absolving him from all responsibility for it. It would not have been wrong in principle to pass a sentence of life imprisonment on a mentally disordered defendant who is criminally responsible and fit to be tried. If one takes what Lord Bingham said in that short passage in Drew
literally and by itself, the questions include whether this is a case where his responsibility for the offence is reduced but not wholly extinguished. If it is argued that a literal application of that would often reduce this Court's discretion under 37 to near vanishing point, the main considerations nevertheless are whether the mental illness so reduced the offender's culpability that, having regard to the need for public protection, a Hospital Order is the right disposal and a sentence of life imprisonment is the wrong disposal.
Mr Taylor submits that the two paragraphs from
Drew
should not be taken by themselves and should not be taken as having reversed what he submits was the well established principle to be derived from a substantial number of cases, certainly before
Drew
and some of them after, where the Court had to make a judgment in all the circumstances in the round as to whether it was right to pass a Hospital Order or a sentence of life imprisonment.
Mr Taylor refers to paragraph 23 of
Drew, were Lord Bingham said this:
""In the course of his argument for the Home Secretary, Mr Perry gently suggested that Court of Appeal decisions generally encouraging the making of hospital orders where the relevant medical criteria were met might, in the absence of adversarial argument, have given less than adequate weight to the differing conditions governing the release and recall of restricted patients as opposed to life sentence prisoners. He instanced authorities such as
R v Howell
(1985) 7 Cr App R(S) 360;
R v Mbatha
(1985) 7 Cr App R(S) 373;
R v Mitchell
[1997] 1 Cr App R(S) 90;
R v Hutchinson
[1997] 2 Cr App R 60
. There may be some force in this criticism, and we would accept that these differing conditions are a matter to which sentencing judges and appellate courts should try to give appropriate weight. The difficulties caused to prison managements by the presence and behaviour of those who are subject to serious mental disorder are, however, notorious, and we would need to be persuaded that any significant change in the prevailing practice was desirable.""
Mr Taylor has referred us this afternoon briefly to a number of those decisions and in addition a case called R v Moses
to indicate what quite clearly has been a prevailing practice. He also drew our attention to the latter part of the judgment of Mustill LJ in
Birch
, from the former part of which Lord Bingham drew part of his paragraph 18 in
Drew
. The passage to which our attention has been drawn follows the point where Mustill LJ had said this:
""(2) Where the sentencer considers that notwithstanding the offender's mental disorder there was an element of culpability in the offence which merits punishment. This may happen where there is no connection between the mental disorder and the offence, or where the defendant's responsibility for the offence is 'diminished' but not wholly extinguished. That the imposition of a prison sentence is capable of being proper exercise of discretion is shown by
Morris
....and
Gunnell
. Nevertheless the more sentence in
Mbatha
.... strongly indicates that even where there is culpability, the right way to deal with a dangerous and disordered person is to make an order under
section 37
and 41.""
Mr Taylor emphasise that last sentence. One authority to which Mr Taylor refers which followed and referred to
Drew
, is
R v IA
[2005] EWCA Crim 2007
, a decision of this Court presided by Mance LJ (as he then was) was on 4th August 2005.
Having considered at considerable length the statutory section and quoted from the House of Lords judgment in
Drew
, Mance LJ said in paragraph 41:
""Accordingly the judge was bound to consider which was the more appropriate in the particular circumstances of this case, a custodial sentence or a hospital order with restriction. That involved weighing factors.""
We have reached the following conclusions: firstly, we are satisfied that the appellant was suffering from mental illness at the time of the offences for which he was sentenced in October 1979. The illness was paranoid schizophrenia. Secondly, we have very carefully considered the extent to which the mental illness may have contributed to the very serious offending to which he pleaded guilty, and whether in the light of that the right order in 1978 was a life sentence of imprisonment and not a Hospital Order.
We have taken account of the passages in the two doctors' written medical reports.
We have been helped by the oral evidence of Dr Exworthy. He was asked questions about the contributions there may have been to this offending from the appellant's personality, his attitude towards women, from alcohol and from his mental illness and although, for the purposes of the present day, Dr Exworthy considered, first, that the mental illness overlay and may have affected the personality and perhaps the disposition to alcohol; second, that in his opinion the mental illness was the predominant factor.
Weighing these and all the other factors that have been put before us, we have concluded that the right order upon the evidence presented to this Court was indeed a hospital order under
section 37
of the Mental Health Act, together with a restriction order without limitation of time under
section 41
of
that Act
.
In our judgment, the formal preconditions for those orders are fulfilled. We have already indicated that we find that the appellant was suffering from mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia.
Accordingly, bearing in mind that a Hospital Order under
section 37
, with a restriction order without limited time under
section 41
, will in the opinion of both doctors be sufficient to protect the public, and in particular women, from anything which the appellant might do in future, we are satisfied that that is the right order now to make.
Accordingly, we allow this appeal and substitute for the sentences of life imprisonment a Hospital Order, with a restriction order without limit of time.","citation:

    Exact: 2. Since the early eighties he has been detained, not in prison, but in a number of secure hospitals, as we understand it upon the direction of the Secretary of State under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, as it now is. The equivalent statute in force at the time of his sentence was the Mental Health Act 1959. It is not suggested that there is any material difference between the provisions of those two statutes centrally relevant to this appeal.3. He is so detained because he is mentally ill. He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.

    Exact: The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.18. Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught. 21. On examination, she was frightened and distressed. The doctor did not find any marks of violence on her body but concluded that she would have been incapable of resisting an active muscular male.22. Counts 6 and 7, attempting to render someone incapable of resistance with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm: on 1st January 1978, a 21 year old woman called Miss G had been to a nightclub in North London and was returning home alone at about 1.30 am by thumbing a lift. She was picked up by the appellant who was driving a van. She noticed that the appellant was shaking continuously and asked to get out. The vehicle was moving and the appellant said, in a fierce voice: ""No, you stop in here."" She tried to open the door but the appellant grabbed both her wrists with one hand and held her tightly. He drove to a dark street in the Victoria area and started to kiss her. She began to scream. The appellant tried to suppress her screams by putting both hands round her throat and he kept pressing to such an extent that she fainted from the pressure being applied. A female passerby was suspicious of the activity in the van and upon closer inspection saw a girl struggling with a man. She opened the passenger door and asked what was going on. This seemed to surprise the appellant, who let go of Miss G who managed to escape from the van. The appellant drove away. The passerby made a note of his registration number and called the police who traced the appellant from the registration number.

    Comment: offence is committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public;
    Exact: The first count, common assault, occurred on 15th April 1977, at about 5 o'clock in the evening when a Miss W, a nurse at Kingston Hospital, was in her room at the nurses' home when there was a knock at door. She opened it and the appellant gained access to the room by posing as an electrician and by stating he come to check the plugs. He began to fiddle with electric switches in the room, then turned and locked the door. He then took the nurse by the arms, sat her on the bed and began talking to her. He told her he had had a girlfriend who had her room and he talked about personal matters relating to him. He gave his name as ""John"". Miss W noticed the smell of alcohol and eventually he went. She was, mercifully, unharmed.18. Counts 2 and 3, burglary and common assault: on 8th December 1977, at about 10 o'clock in the evening, the appellant used the same method to gain access to a Miss L's room at the nurses' home. He entered her room and as he did so put his hand across her mouth and another arm round her neck in a grip to ensure she could not scream. She promised him not to scream and he let her go and then lay on the bed. He made her light a cigarette for him and talk to her about his sexual difficulties. She eventually managed to get to the door and scream for help. She was heard by two of her friends who attended to her as the appellant left the room. Miss L was in a frightened state but there were no substantial injuries on examination.19. Count 4, a count of common assault, occurred at about 11.15 pm on the same evening. The appellant approached a Miss K, a housekeeper at the hospital, as she walked through the hospital grounds. He asked her for directions to a ward in the hospital and asked if she was a nurse. He then grasped her by the throat. She screamed and the appellant ran away. She was examined and found to be distraught and fearful but there were no substantial injuries.20. Count 5, rape: shortly after at about 11.30 pm that same evening, the appellant returned to the student nurses' home and into a corridor where a student nurse, Miss B, was just returning to her home. She asked him what he wanted. He asked her what her room number was and again entered by claiming that he was an electrician. When he got into the room he pushed her onto the bed, put a hand over her mouth and said: ""You know what I am, you know what I want, I want you to love me"". While she was struggling he put his hand around her neck in a stifling or choking manner and he put two fingers down her throat to make her less likely to react. He then touched her private parts and partly undressed her. He then raped her. She was too frightened to struggle against him. They remained in her room from 11.30 pm until 8 o'clock the next morning. Every time she tried to move the appellant woke up. A friend called for her to go to work at 8.00 am. The friend opened the door and found her in a distressed condition, with the appellant hiding behind the open door. She was able to get out of the door and away. The appellant managed to get dressed and leave the building without being caught.

LORD JUSTICE FLAUX:
1.
On 13 April 2018, in the Crown Court at Maidstone before His Honour Judge Statman, the appellant pleaded guilty to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. On 8 May 2018, he was sentenced by the same judge to seven and a half years' imprisonment concurrent on each of the counts of causing death by dangerous driving and 3 years' imprisonment
concurrent on the count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, a total of seven and a half years' imprisonment. The judge also imposed a period of disqualification from driving of 7 years. He now appeals against sentence with the leave of the single
judge.
2.
The facts of this tragic incident can be summarised as follows. On the evening of 23 September 2017, the appellant, then aged 29, had been to two public houses in the Hawkhurst area with two work colleagues, Stephen Jones and Roy Little, and two teenagers, Chelsea-Rose Betts, aged 16, and her brother, Billy Bartley, aged 13. They were all friends. The appellant was the driver of the car in which they travelled, a Volvo Estate, but despite being the driver, he was drinking alcohol.
3.
There were witnesses who spoke of his having driven away from the first pub erratically and too fast, but the appellant made no admissions about this in his basis of plea, and Billy Bartley, who provided the police with an ABE interview, did not refer to this, so that, in sentencing the appellant, the judge fairly took into account only his driving on leaving the second pub, The Oak and Ivy on Rye Road in Hawkhurst, sometime around 9.30 pm. A witness at that pub described how, as it pulled away, the car was being
driven fast and erratically with a spin of the wheels.
4.
Another witness was driving in the opposite direction shortly before the impact occurred. She described driving towards Hawkhurst on the A268 Rye Road. It was a dry night with no street lighting at the relevant part and it was dark. She saw headlights coming from the opposite direction and she could see from the position of the headlights that the car was near enough on her side of the road. It was coming towards her quite fast and she said that the headlights appeared to be on full beam. She slowed down, not knowing what else to do as it was coming towards her so fast. As it passed her she could see that it was a red car but it was driving too fast for her to determine what type of car. She described how her own car made a little wobble as the other car went past. She estimated its speed as being between 50 and 60 miles an hour and there were no other
cars on the road.
5.
Billy Bartley said in his ABE interview on 18 October 2017 that there was nothing wrong with the appellant's driving at the start of the evening. It was only after going to the one pub and then to the next, that Billy Bartley became concerned and then very concerned about the way the vehicle was being driven. He did say that on previous occasions when he had been in the car the appellant had driven responsibly. He said that the driving was
only fast from the last pub.
6.
Stephen Munroe was a driving instructor of 25 years' experience. At 9.30 pm he pulled up at his house on Rye Road and heard the sound of a car being driven at high speed. He saw the lights of a car coming round the bend some 150 to 200 yards away and as the car came round the corner he observed the noise from it momentarily stopped, which was consistent with it being airborne, but he then heard a loud noise of the tyres hitting the road and screeching before he heard a thud followed by silence. From his experience he could tell that the vehicle was being driven at excessive speed.
7.
WPC Rachael Barker was the first police officer on the scene, having been flagged down by members of the public. She saw the vehicle on its side on the pavement. Billy Bartley was lying on the ground outside the car with a head injury. She observed petrol on the ground and she ascertained that there were two adults within the vehicle. The appellant was conscious and able to speak. The female was also conscious at that time. When the appellant was removed from the vehicle, he said, ""I swerved for a car on the
corner"".
8.
Mr Little and Mr Jones died at the scene and Chelsea-Rose Betts sadly died of her injuries in hospital 3 days later. Billy Bartley sustained a number of injuries. A CT scan revealed a pneumothorax, a lung laceration, three rib fractures and a fractured collarbone. He had a laceration to his scalp, two lacerations to his tongue and bruising
to the chest wall. He was in hospital for 3 days, of which 2 days were in intensive care.
9.
A forensic collision investigation by the police indicated that the accident had occurred at a location where the road bends to the left with a slight incline of 5 per cent. It was a single carriageway with a white painted double line. There was no street lighting and the speed limit was 40 miles an hour. The car, when examined, was severely damaged and deformed, the main impact being to the roof, which was consistent with it striking the kerb with the nearside wheels, and from the reconstruction it would appear the vehicle was travelling around a left-hand bend, harsh steering or braking was applied, causing it to rotate clockwise across the road. By the time it reached the offside kerb it had rotated far enough so that its nearside wheel struck the kerb, which was the most likely cause of
the car tipping onto its nearside, whereupon it collided roof first with a brick wall.
10.
The investigation could not establish the pre-impact speed, although based upon damage to the car it was likely to be in excess of 40 miles an hour and from witness descriptions
it was likely that the vehicle became airborne over the crest of the road. The expert's opinion was that a vehicle being driven within the speed limit would not have left the road, nor would it have had any difficulty in negotiating the bend. It appeared likely that the driver overreacted to an actual or perceived loss of control while negotiating the left-hand bend and he either braked or steered harshly towards the right or both. That caused the vehicle to yaw clockwise and to cross to the opposing lane, where it struck the kerb and overturned. The expert found there were no contributory road, vehicle or weather factors save that the rear offside tyre had a slow puncture, which would not have been discernible when being driven on a straight road but it was possible that it had a noticeable adverse effect on a bend.
11.
The appellant provided a sample of blood and was found to be over the legal drink drive limit. He was found to have 87 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, where the legal limit is 80 micrograms, but the test was not performed immediately after the collision, but only some 5 hours later and it not been possible in the circumstances to
make a precise calculation as to the effect on the blood.
12.
The appellant was interviewed. He said he had drunk a moderate amount of alcohol and he did not think it affected his driving. He said he knew the road where the collision had occurred very well. He claimed that he was driving within the speed limit and said he could not understand how the collision had occurred. He denied that he had been
driving too fast or had driven erratically at any stage of the evening.
13.
The appellant was born on 14 June 1987 and was of previous good character with no previous convictions and he had a clean full driving licence and proper insurance for the car.
14.
He pleaded guilty at the PTPH on a written basis of plea which admitted that he was over the legal limit at the time of driving. He accepted driving away from the Oak and Ivy too fast and that, once on the main road, he was driving in excess of the 40 mile an hour limit. As he approached the bend he was at a speed at or around 50 miles an hour and he appeared to have misjudged the corner and swerved. As a consequence, he tried to correct the position of the car but the rear had swerved dramatically to the left. As it swerved, and either before or as a consequence of hitting the pavement, the car went airborne, before rolling onto its side, coming to rest in the direction it had been driven from. He accepted that had he been driving within the speed limit he should have been able to negotiate the corner.
15.
The basis of plea also stated that the car had passed its MOT a few weeks before the accident. It had no obvious defect that would have contributed to the accident. However, examination of the car in the immediate aftermath of the accident indicated that there was a slow puncture to the rear offside tyre and the pressure was 16 PSI when it was recommended to be 29 PSI. There was nothing to suggest that the appellant should have been aware of the deflation prior to the accident. Forensics had noted that the reduced pressure on the tyre could have had an adverse effect on the ability to control the vehicle. During his interview, the appellant had said that the characteristics of the car felt different on the corner and he remembered the back end losing control and forensics said it was possible he was describing the effects of the underinflated tyre. At the conclusion of the forensic report it had stated that the rear offside tyre may have
adversely affected the handling characteristics of the car.
16.
There were victim impact statements before the judge from Mr Little's mother, Mr Jones' mother, and Chelsea-Rose Betts' mother and grandmother. We have also read these. They speak movingly of the terrible impact of the deaths of Mr Little, Mr Jones and Miss Betts on their families.
17.
In careful and sensitive sentencing remarks, the judge referred to the fact that the appellant had been drinking alcohol at the two pubs they visited that night. He said that, looking at it in its most favourable light to the appellant, on the occasion when he left the second pub it became clear to those in the vicinity, as well as to Billy, who was one of his passengers, that his car was being driven in a dangerous manner. The speed limit on the road he was driving was 40 miles an hour and on any view of his speed it was at least 50 miles an hour, so he was driving having taken alcohol and above the speed limit. There were witnesses who saw him drive who described his driving as being unacceptable. It would seem, he said, from Billy's account that there had effectively been a change in the manner in which the appellant was driving. The consequences of that driving had been
catastrophic: three people killed and Billy seriously injured.
18.
The judge referred to the forensic investigation report and noted in particular that the report stated that it was likely that the driver overreacted to an actual or perceived loss of control. Those words, ""actual or perceived loss of control"", the judge regarded as significant, particularly when one bore in mind that he was someone who had taken alcohol in the course of the evening. There were no contributory road, weather or vehicle factors other than the slow puncture. It was a possibility that that had had some adverse effect in the course of his driving around the bend and one which was accepted,
in fairness to him, would not necessarily have been noticeable on a straight road.
19.
The judge referred to the letters which the appellant had written to the families of the deceased and various testimonials and he concluded that the appellant was genuinely remorseful for what he had done. He referred to the appellant's previous good character and good driving record and he accepted that what he did that evening would be with him
for the rest of his life. However, the judge said that it was important to emphasise that Billy, Chelsea's brother, had had to live through the crash and come to court in circumstances where his sister had been taken from him. Also the court bore in mind the grief of Chelsea's mother. It was particularly significant that no-one had had a chance to
say goodbye. That was a very great tragedy.
20.
The judge said this was not a case where the defendant had set out in the morning with evil and malice in mind, intent upon causing death, but it was absolutely impossible to quantify the loss which had been sustained by the families, where three people were killed and one seriously injured, and to some way equate that in terms of years to each death in the sentence to be passed.
21.
The judge then referred to the Definitive Guideline of the Sentencing Council on causing death by driving. He said this was not an easy case. He said that he had indicated at the outset of the sentencing hearing his concern that the case could not be described as falling at any stage into category 2 in the Guideline. Having considered the Guideline and counsel's helpful submissions, it had become clear that it became a category 1 case, even though it may have started as category 2. The judge considered that in placing the case firmly in category 1, paragraphs 19 to 21 of the Guideline were significant, particularly
paragraph 21, which he quoted:
""Where more than one person is killed, that will aggravate the seriousness of the offence because of the increase in harm. Where the number of people killed is high and that was reasonably foreseeable, the number of deaths is likely to provide sufficient justification for moving an offence into the next highest sentencing band.""
22.
The judge said that this was a case of higher culpability because the appellant knew how many passengers were in his vehicle and they were all his responsibility because he was the driver. This was to be contrasted with a case of a driver on his own who crashes into another car which tragically has a number of people in it. So the judge concluded this was higher culpability and greater harm because of the number of deaths. The starting point for category 1 was 8 years' custody and the range 7 to 14 years. The judge noted that that upper limit reflected that Parliament had revisited and increased the earlier maximum for this offence.
23.
The judge said that he had to look at the aggravating factors, whilst being careful not to double count, and then balance them with the available mitigation. This was not an easy task. So many had suffered so considerably as a result of his actions and this was yet another case involving a complete lack of understanding, that going to a public house, drinking alcohol, leaving and driving a vehicle and driving that vehicle at speed and being involved in such an incident could only lead to a substantial and immediate
custodial sentence to protect the public.
24.
Having looked at the aggravating and mitigating features, the judge started at 10 years' imprisonment and reduced that to reflect the appellant's guilty pleas by 25 per cent to seven and a half years' imprisonment concurrent on each of counts 1 to 3. Bearing in mind the maximum for the count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving was 5 years and having given credit for his plea, the sentence came to 3 years' imprisonment
concurrent to the other sentences.
25.
In his helpful submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr Tyrone Smith QC contends that the judge's starting point of 10 years' imprisonment before credit for the guilty plea was too high since it indicated that before reduction for mitigating features the judge's starting position must in fact have been significantly in excess of 10 years. Whilst he accepts that the judge was right to increase the sentence to take account of the multiple deaths and the injury caused to Billy Bartley, he submitted in his written advice that care had to
be taken that this did not entirely overwhelm the appellant's culpability. Had the judge started at category 2 before aggravating for the deaths caused, the starting point should have been 5 years, but the judge had effectively more than doubled that, before taking account of the mitigation. Mr Smith submitted that to the extent that the judge had taken account as an aggravating feature the consumption of alcohol, this was, in effect, double counting, since the consumption of alcohol was a matter which put the case in category 2
rather than category 3 in the first place.
26.
Mr Smith submitted that the mitigating features were significant. They included that this may have been a case where there would not have been an accident at all but for the unknown defect in the vehicle, namely the slow puncture, of which the appellant was unaware. There was also the remorse shown by the appellant, the fact that those killed were his close friends, which the Guideline says specifically at paragraph 23 may be a mitigating factor, together with his good driving record and his previous good character. Mr Smith also submitted that, of course, the appellant has to live for the rest of his life
with having caused these deaths and serious injury.
27.
Attractively though the submissions were presented, we cannot accept them. We agree with what is said by Mr Connolly for the Crown in the Respondent's Notice, that within category 1 on the facts of this case, the judge was entitled to take a starting point in excess of the 8-year starting point in the Guideline to reflect a number of serious
aggravating features of the case.
28.
We consider that the judge was entitled to stand back and look at the overall seriousness of the offending. The aggravating features of the offending included the fact that the appellant caused three deaths, one of them a 16-year-old girl, and that, given that they were passengers in his car, this was a case where he could anticipate the possible deaths
of those passengers. The fact that the appellant was driving at excessive speed whilst over the drink drive limit was, as the judge rightly identified, a very important aggravating feature. We do not accept Mr Smith's submissions that in taking that into account as an aggravating feature the judge somehow was guilty of double counting. As we said to Mr Smith during the course of argument, it seemed to us that many of his arguments in relation to the Guideline tended to adopt the approach of treating it as tramlines, which is an approach which has been deprecated time and time again in this court.
29.
Perhaps most importantly in terms of aggravation, the judge also had to take account of the additional aggravating factor of various very serious injuries to a 13-year-old boy, who had also lost his sister through the appellant's dangerous driving. On the basis that the judge was going to pass a concurrent sentence on that count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, the judge was entitled to take a significantly higher starting point on the causing death by dangerous driving counts to take account of the serious injury to
Billy Bartley and to reflect the gravity of the overall offending - see
Attorney General's
Reference (R v Morrison)
[2018] EWCA Crim 981
; [2018] 2 Cr App R (S) 31 at
paragraphs 23 to 24. We also consider that the judge clearly took full account of the
various mitigating factors to which Mr Smith has referred.
30.
In our judgment, this sentence cannot begin to be described as manifestly excessive or
wrong in principle. The appeal against sentence must be dismissed.
31.
It is necessary to say something about the period of disqualification passed by the judge.
The judge does not appear to have followed the guidance provided by this court in
R v
Needham
[2016] EWCA Crim 455
, that the sentencing court should state the
discretionary period of disqualification deemed appropriate together with the extension period to be added pursuant to section 35A of the Road Traffic Act 1988. In fairness to the judge, he does seem to have complied with the purpose of the legislation in passing a period of disqualification of 7 years. In doing so, he referred to the fact that the appellant would be in custody for the first three and a half years, evidently considering that this was the appropriate extension period under section 35A of half the custodial term, although, because he mistakenly thought the appellant would be entitled to time off his sentence for days spent in custody, he took the custodial term as three and a half years. The appellant had in fact been on bail. So half the custodial term would be 3 years and 9 months.
32.
We propose to restructure the period of disqualification so as to comply with the guidance given in
Needham
. The extension period under section 35A will be 3 years and 9 months. The discretionary period of disqualification will be 3 years and 3 months. Thus, the overall period of disqualification remains 7 years, as does the requirement for
the appellant to pass an extended driving test.

Judgment
Lord Justice Treacy:
1.
This is an application for leave to appeal against conviction referred to the full court by the single judge. In addition there is an application for an extension of time of a little over 6 years.
2.
The applicant was convicted of murder on 15th January 2009 at the Central Criminal Court. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 27 years less time spent on remand.
3.
The applicant was tried alongside his partner Simone Manning and Marlon Golding. Both of those defendants were acquitted of assisting an offender. A further co-accused, Lumsden, was convicted of assisting an offender. The facts of the case show that the victim was a 17 year old female member of a dance troupe called X-squad. Simone Manning’s sister was a member of that group and was in dispute with the other members. This led to a violent confrontation on 20th June 2007 referred to as the “Bruce Grove Incident”. The applicant and Simone Manning had actively taken the sister’s side.
4.
In the small hours of 23rd June 2007 the applicant, the Manning sisters and Golding went to the Swan nightclub in Tottenham. The deceased arrived with members of X-squad at about 3.20 am. There was continuing animosity between the groups. The applicant was seen making gestures and movements suggesting that he had a gun in the waistband of his trousers.
5.
At about 5 am a fight broke out between the two groups and the applicant became involved. He was seen by a number of witnesses to have a gun. This was also captured by CCTV footage. The gun was fired and the deceased was shot in the head, receiving fatal injuries.
6.
Shortly after the shooting Golding drove the applicant and Simone Manning to an address in Purfleet. The applicant then travelled to Oxford where he stayed for a number of weeks at an address rented by Lumsden until his arrest on 20th July 2007.
7.
In interview the applicant admitted presence at the nightclub. He initially lied, denying possession of the gun or shooting the deceased. He claimed that the shot had come from behind him and blamed a man named Akim. When shown the CCTV footage he made no further comment to questions. By the time of trial he admitted that his original account was untrue. His new account was that a man named Campbell had the gun and had produced it as he approached the applicant in the nightclub. The applicant’s case was that he struggled with Campbell and managed to disarm him whereupon the gun discharged accidentally. He had not deliberately fired the gun into the crowd.
8.
The issues for the jury were whether they were sure that the applicant deliberately fired the gun killing the deceased and whether he had the requisite intention for murder.
9.
The Crown’s case was a strong one. There were witnesses who said that the applicant had threatened to use a gun during the preceding dispute at Bruce Grove. There were witnesses who had seen the applicant with a gun in the nightclub both before and at the time of the shooting. There was evidence of a previous incident at the club in 2006 when the applicant was said to have pulled a handgun from his waistband in the course of a dispute with the licensee. The CCTV footage did not appear to be consistent with the applicant’s explanation at trial. In addition, the applicant disputed all the major points of evidence implicating him, meaning that a large number of witnesses as to separate events combined to put forward a false account. The judge gave an adverse inference direction in relation to the applicant’s change of account.
10.
The co-accused Simone Manning, who had been present in the club gave evidence consistent with the applicant’s case. She had not seen the shooting itself but said that the applicant had later told her it was an accident.
11.
Marlon Golding gave evidence, both as to the events in Bruce Grove and the club, which was consistent with the applicant’s case. In particular his evidence was supportive of the account given by the applicant in relation to Campbell and he said that the applicant had subsequently told him about the struggle with Campbell and accidental discharge of the gun. There was a difference in the evidence of the applicant and Golding as to the point in time that that conversation took place. Golding said it was during the journey to Purfleet, whereas the applicant described it as taking place after arrival there.
12.
There are two grounds of appeal advanced before us by the applicant. Firstly, it is submitted that the proceedings against the co-accused Marlon Golding were a nullity in that he was sent for trial on the charge of assisting an offender on 22nd August 2007 but that the DPP did not give consent until 10th October 2007, prior to his first appearance at the Central Criminal Court on 29th October.
13.
Mr Richmond relies on the decision in
R v Welsh & ors
[2016] 1 Cr App R 9
at [54] for the proposition that that the DPP’s consent must be obtained prior to a defendant being sent for trial pursuant to
section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998
. Mr Richmond acknowledged that having regard to
Welsh
at [65] and [71]-[73], where more than 28 days have passed since conviction and an applicant requires an extension of time, such an extension will not be granted unless it can be demonstrated that it is necessary to cure a substantial injustice. He states that the issue as to nullity was unnoticed by Golding’s legal team or indeed any other party to the case. The applicant subsequently became alive to the potential issue through his own enquiries.
14.
Mr Richmond submitted that Golding was improperly included on the indictment as a co-defendant at the trial of this applicant. He should not have been on the indictment at all. Although Golding’s evidence was broadly supportive of the applicant’s final case, their evidence had been contradictory in relation to the applicant’s post-shooting account of accident. This did collateral damage to the applicant’s case and was a situation which should not properly have occurred. If Golding had not been a co-accused it would have been a finely balanced decision as to whether to call him to give evidence. In the circumstances the applicant was significantly prejudiced and the verdict was unsafe.
15.
The second ground of appeal relates to evidence which the jury heard to the effect that this applicant had a conviction for assault against Simone Manning and had also been cautioned on three occasions, once for assault. The point taken is that those elements of bad character should not have been admitted because they had no probative value with regard to the count on the indictment. We say at once that there is no substance at all in this further ground and Mr Richmond did not seek to argue it. The applicant had himself adduced those aspects of his bad character in the course of his evidence, presumably with a view to showing that he did not have any significant criminal record for violence. Whatever his motivation, the judge directed the jury in summing up that they should ignore those matters in reaching their verdict. In the context of the charge and the evidence in the case there is absolutely no prospect of the admission of those matters rendering the conviction unsafe. We reject this ground.
16.
In relation to the first ground, Mr Mably, for the respondent, makes three overarching submissions: firstly that the consent of the DPP was not required because, on analysis, the proceedings were instituted by the DPP, thus satisfying the requirements of
section 4(4) of the Criminal Law Act 1967
. This is for two reasons: (a) a Crown prosecutor made a charging decision in accordance with the statutory charging procedure before Golding was charged and before his case was sent to the Crown Court; (b) where a person is charged as a result of a decision under section 37B of PACE the proceedings are to be regarded as having been instituted by the DPP (by a Crown prosecutor exercising the DPP’s functions pursuant to
section 1(6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985)
, and not by the police.
17.
Where material, section 37B provides:
“(2) the DPP shall decide whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the person with an offence;
(3) if he decides that there is sufficient evidence to charge the person with an offence, he shall decide –
(a) whether or not the person should be charged and, if so, the offence with which he should be charged …
(4) The Director of Public Prosecutions shall give notice of his decision to an officer involved in the investigation of the offence. …
(6) If the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions is that the person should be charged with an offence … the person shall be charged … accordingly.”
18.
Mr Mably’s second overall submission, by way of alternative, is that even if it were concluded that the proceedings in Golding’s case were not instituted by the DPP, the charging decision made by her (through a Crown Prosecutor) amounts to consent to institute proceedings for the purposes of
section 4(4) of the Criminal Law Act 1967
. The charging decision involves a consideration of whether the evidence if sufficient to justify bringing a charge and whether a prosecution is in the public interest. It also involves the selection of the appropriate charge. The decision is notified to the police, and under section 37B(6) of PACE it must be implemented by them. This process constitutes more than mere consent: it is the actual decision to institute proceedings and a direction for its implementation by the police. As a matter of substance, reality and logic, the giving of consent is subsumed by or contained within that decision. Since the charging decision in Golding’s case constitutes consent to institute proceedings any separate later consent decision in October 2007 was superfluous.
19.
Mr Mably’s third submission was that acceptance of either of his first two submissions would mean that the proceedings against Golding were not a nullity. Were the court to hold otherwise so that the charge against him was improperly joined and tried on the indictment involving the applicant, there is no tenable basis upon which it could be argued that the conviction is unsafe. If Golding’s charge was a nullity that would not bear on the validity of the charge against this applicant. Moreover the evidence against this applicant was exceptionally strong. Insofar as Golding’s position affected that of the applicant, his evidence supported the applicant’s case in all material respects that includes supporting the applicant’s account given after the event that the shooting had been an accident. The inconsistency of detail as to that was not a significant matter in the context of the case. Accordingly any nullity of the proceedings against Golding would not bear on the safety of the applicant’s conviction.
20.
The relevant chronology in Golding’s case is that he was initially arrested on 27th June 2007 and bailed to 5th July. He was further bailed to 21st August. In the interim, a Crown prosecutor made a charging decision on 4th August 2007. In so doing he employed the threshold test set out under the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under
section 37A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
. This also encompassed a consideration of the statutory charging procedures set out in section 37B of PACE which provides that when a case is referred by police to the DPP, the DPP shall decide whether there is sufficient evidence to charge and if he does so it is for the DPP to decide which offence shall be charged and then to notify the police of his decision. The provisions of
section 1(6)
and
1(7)
of the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985
mean that every Crown prosecutor is for these purposes to be treated as being in the shoes of the DPP. The charging decision of 4th August 2007 was recorded on an MG3 document.
21.
As a consequence of this when Golding reported to his bail on 21st August 2007 he was charged by the police with the offence of assisting an offender. On the following day the case was sent by the magistrates’ court to the Central Criminal Court.
22.
On 29th August the case was reviewed in accordance with the Full Code test once the police had submitted the full charging file. Thereafter on 10th October 2007 a separate written consent was confirmed by a Crown prosecutor.
23.
We have seen the MG3 document relating to the charging decision of 4th August 2007. It shows that on that date a prosecutor delivered face to face advice on charging to the police. The prosecutor indicated that he had seen CCTV footage and applied the threshold test. He said there was a clear case to answer and specified the offence of assisting an offender as a charge in relation to Golding. There was thus a clear charging decision notified to the police for them to implement. It is true that the form included a section entitled “DPP consent” under which was entered the words “not appropriate”. Mr Richmond contended that this showed that the prosecutor on 4th August had not consented to the institution of proceedings. He supported this submission by the fact that a different Crown prosecutor had expressly given consent in relation to Golding on 10th October.
24.
We have reviewed the documentation in relation to Golding and also that concerning his co-accused Manning and Lumsden. It is right to say that there are some apparently anomalous entries on the face of the documentation but we are entirely satisfied that on 4th August a Crown prosecutor considered the evidence, and made a charging decision which he then communicated to the police. We return later to the question of whether this constitutes a consent to the institution of proceedings in the light of Mr Richmond’s submissions that it does not.
25.
Mr Richmond’s submissions are essentially based on 10th October as representing the date of the DPP’s consent. If he is correct in this then the decision in
Welsh
shows that where an indictable only offence is involved the appropriate consent must be obtained prior to a sending to the Crown Court under
section 51
of
the 1998 Act
. Sending in this case took place on 22nd August.
26.
In this context we note that both
Welsh
and the earlier decision of this Court in
R v Lambert
[2009] 2 Cr App R 32
were decided after this trial had concluded in January 2009 and are decisions on the question of when proceedings are instituted in the light of modern attempts to streamline the criminal justice system. Earlier decisions such as
R v Elliott
[1985] Cr App R 115, and
R v Whale & Lockton
[1991] Crim LR 692 applied the principle that proceedings were instituted when the accused came to court to answer the charge. In the case of an indictable only offence under older procedures that would not take place until arraignment at the Plea and Case Management Hearing.
Whale & Lockton
was relied on by the Crown prosecutor in giving the consent of 10th October. Therefore it appears that at the time which these proceedings were concerned matters proceeded on a basis consistent with the law as it was then understood prior to elucidation in
Lambert
and
Welsh
. In this context see [61]-[70] of
Welsh
from which it is clear that the modern procedural arrangements call for a re-appraisal of the point by which consent must be given. As was stated in
R v Bull
(1994) 99 Cr App R 193
at page 206:
“When considering the question whether proceedings have been instituted by a specified person or by or with the consent of a specified person it is essential to have regard to the particular procedure adopted in the given case.”
27.
If there was a failure to give or obtain the necessary consent before proceedings were instituted then there is no doubt that the subsequent proceedings would be a nullity – see
R v Christopher Welsh (Jr)
[2016] 1 Cr App R 8
at [14] and [15] and
R v Pearce
(1981) 72 Cr App R 295
. However if a count on an indictment is a nullity for want of consent that defect does not nullify other counts on the indictment or the overall proceedings. The indictment as a whole is not invalidated, only the count or counts improperly joined – see
R v McGrath
[2013] EWCA Crim 1261
at [33]. Mr Richmond did not argue to the contrary but submits that if the operative decision is that of 10th October, it came too late.
28.
Section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1967
deals with assisting offenders and subsection (4) provides: “No proceedings shall be instituted for an offence under subsection (1) above except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions”. It follows from that that
section 4(4)
is satisfied if the proceedings are instituted by the DPP or if the proceedings are instituted with her consent. It seems to us that as a matter of statutory construction if the DPP institutes the proceedings the requirements of the subsection are satisfied and there is no need for a separate consent to be given. Consent is only required if some person other than the DPP such as the police institutes the criminal proceedings.
29.
Since the statutory charging scheme at section 37B of PACE was introduced by the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
following the recommendations of Auld LJ’s
Review of the Criminal Courts
, it is the DPP through Crown prosecutors who determines the charge and arguably initiates the prosecution. It seems to us that, having regard to the terms of section 37B cited above, a Crown prosecutor who has decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge and who has identified the relevant offence and notified the police of his decision has either instituted proceedings personally in which case no separate act of consent is necessary or, alternatively, has required the police to charge the offender, in which case notification of the decision constitutes the giving of consent. We are satisfied that the actions of the prosecutor on 4th August described above constitute consent. To consider the evidence, determine the charge and then inform the police that they must charge an accused with that offence necessarily connotes consent to the charge.
30.
We therefore conclude that the prosecutor’s action of 4th August 2007 amounted to the necessary consent. This being a leave application, it has not been necessary for us to determine whether that giving of consent also constitutes the institution of proceedings as Mr Mably’s first submission contended, or whether proceedings were instituted by notification of the charge to Golding on 21st August 2007 when he was re-arrested after surrender to bail (see
section 15(2)(c)
of
the 1985 Act
), or whether his sending to the Crown Court on the following day pursuant to
the 1998 Act
amounted to the institution of proceedings in the light of
Welsh
.
Welsh
is a decision concerned with the requirement for the Attorney General to consent to the institution of proceedings under the
Criminal Law Act 1977
. It may be that in a future case that issue might need to be resolved.
31.
However in the present case, the parties adopted the approach that on any view, if consent had been given on 4th August, it would have been a valid consent given at a relevant time with the consequence that there was no question of nullity in relation to the proceedings against Golding. We did not receive any submissions on the point raised in the preceding paragraph.
32.
The later act of a Crown prosecutor on 10th October in purporting to give a consent which would have been valid as the law was then understood, is to be regarded as mere surplusage in the light of a previously valid consent having been given or obtained. Since we hold that there was no nullity involved, there can be no complaint about joinder of Golding, so that the assertion of unfairness to this applicant falls to the ground.
33.
Even if we had been persuaded that Golding’s proceedings were a nullity we do not think that there is any arguable case that the applicant’s conviction is unsafe. We regard the strength of the evidence against this applicant as having been particularly robust. Moreover, the evidence given by Golding was broadly supportive of the applicant’s case as indeed was the evidence given by the co-accused Manning. In the context of the case as a whole we see no substance in the suggestion that Golding’s presence materially undermined the applicant’s case. To the extent that the Crown could point to a discrepancy in their accounts relating the applicant’s explanation of accident, this is not a factor that could render the verdict unsafe. In those circumstances where there has been no substantial prejudice caused to the applicant we decline to grant an extension of time since it has not been shown that one is necessary to cure a substantial injustice. For the reasons given we also dismiss this application relating to conviction.","citation:

THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
I shall ask Mr Justice Warby to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE WARBY:
1. This is an application for leave to appeal against conviction by Danhyal Younis Khan, who is now aged 25. He is one of three men who faced trial in April 2017 in the Crown Court at Birmingham on a single count of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of a prohibition on the importation of goods, contrary to section 170(2)(b) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.
2. The co-accused were the applicant's uncle, Naeem Younis, and a friend of the applicant's named Kaif Bahar. The goods in question were Class A drugs. Put simply, the three men were alleged to have taken part in the importation of heroin between 9
th
and 19
th
October 2016.
3. There is no doubt that, within that time frame, the applicant was knowingly involved in the importation from Pakistan of about 0.8 kilograms of heroin. His uncle pleaded guilty at the start of the trial. On his own account, at the instigation of his uncle, the applicant agreed to and did assume a false identity. In that identity he arranged to and did accept delivery of a parcel from a courier, knowing that it contained drugs. He had admitted this much in the course of his trial before His Honour Judge Simon Drew QC and a jury. His defence was that he had acted under duress.
4. The applicant gave evidence. The judge then made two rulings against him. In the first, the judge refused to allow him to be recalled to give further evidence. The second ruling was that the defence of duress should not be left to the jury. The applicant then changed his plea and was convicted on the basis of his plea of guilty.
5. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against conviction. He initially challenged both of the judge's rulings which we have mentioned, but at the hearing today counsel has focused attention on the second ruling and has not pursued the challenge to the judge's refusal to allow the applicant to be recalled.
6. Meanwhile, whilst these proceedings go ahead, sentence on the applicant and his uncle has been deferred, and the jury has been discharged from returning a verdict against Behar. A retrial is scheduled. The single judge referred the present application to this court for pragmatic reasons – to minimise delay – without expressing any view on the merits.
The Facts
7. The prosecution evidence can be shortly summarised on the basis of the judge's written ruling handed down on 2
nd
May 2017. On 13
th
October 2016 a parcel was sent from Islamabad to Birmingham via the DHL courier service. Inside the parcel were six leather jackets within which were concealed 98 packages containing 794 grams of heroin, with a street value in the order of £80,000. The consignee was named as a Mr Zaheer Khan of 55 Fentham Road, Aston, Birmingham.
8. Telephone records showed that the applicant's uncle was in regular contact with someone in Pakistan in the days immediately following the sending of the parcel. During that time, the uncle was also in contact with the applicant on his phone ending 5765.
9. On 14
th
October 2016 the parcel cleared customs at Heathrow. Later that day, the applicant activated a pay-as-you-go phone ending 8278.
10. On 15
th
October 2016, Younis sent a text message to the applicant's 8278 phone giving him the DHL tracking number for the parcel.
11. On 17
th
October 2016, the applicant called DHL on the 8278 phone just after 8am. In a recorded call, of which a transcript was before the jury, he represented himself to be Zaheer Khan and asked if the parcel was due to be delivered that day. He was told that it was, at any time between 9am and 5.50pm. He asked if any duty had to be paid and was told that £96 was due. Later that day, he called DHL a further four times using the same phone. However, the parcel did not arrive.
12. The following day, 18
th
October 2016, Luke Smith, a delivery driver for DHL, was rostered to deliver the parcel. He stopped his van in Fentham Road, near number 55, shortly before 1pm. He was then approached by Bahar who asked him if he had a delivery for number 55. When Mr Smith said that he did, Bahar said that he thought that duty was payable and Mr Smith confirmed this. The applicant then approached Mr Smith and, identifying himself as Zaheer Khan, signed for the parcel. At that point either he or Bahar paid the outstanding duty. Who did so was a matter that was disputed between the defendants. The parcel was then put in the boot of Bahar's car and the two men drove off with it. Shortly afterwards, they were stopped and arrested. The car was searched and the parcel was seized.
13. Both men were interviewed. Then declined to comment to all questions. Younis was arrested later. All three men were sent for trial.
14. When the applicant gave evidence in chief he provided a detailed account of what he said was his involvement in the importation of heroin and the background to it. His account filled in some details of his participation. He said that he had agreed with his uncle to sign for the parcel, after which Younis had given him a mobile phone and a SIM card pack and told him to put the SIM in the phone and use it to call DHL about the progress of the parcel. He said that he had failed to activate the SIM and lost it, so that when Younis called him on 14
th
October to check, he decided to buy another pack. Having done so, he put the SIM with the 8278 number in the phone. On 15
th
October, having obtained the reference number from Younis, the applicant went on the DHL website to track the parcel and in that way discovered that there was £96 duty to pay. On 17
th
October he called DHL and was told that delivery was due that day. He spent most of the day on Fentham Road with Bahar waiting for the parcel. It was in the course of this period that he made the four chasing calls, only to be told that the lorry had broken down. That was just after 5pm.
15. He then called Younis, who called DHL himself and reported to the applicant that delivery would be the following day. Hence, on 18
th
October, the applicant and Bahar returned and waited on Fentham Road and in due course received the parcel. The applicant's evidence was that it was Bahar who paid the duty.
16. The chief features of the background, according to the applicant, were these. He was very close to Younis, who is 35 years of age. They were more like brothers. He said that on the night of 10
th
/11
th
September 2016 Younis had been shot in the arm close to Younis' place of work, which was at a sheesha lounge where the applicant had been working. The applicant saw Younis shortly after this. After a period in hospital Younis came to live with the applicant's family. They spoke about the shooting. Younis refused to go to the police about what had happened. He said that he did not trust the police and that someone called Kiyani, who was a relative of the applicant, and Kiyani's mates would kill him if they found out that he had gone to the police.
17. About a week and a half to two weeks before the applicant's arrest, Younis told him that Kiyani had demanded that he did a favour, or he would be shot again. The favour required was to sign for a parcel. The applicant believed that the parcel might contain drugs because he knew that Kiyani had previously been arrested for importing drugs. The applicant again suggested that Younis go to the police, but Younis again refused to do so. He repeated that he did not trust the police and that if he did so ""they"" would shoot him or his kids. Younis said that he feared that he was being set up to attend a meeting where he would be shot. Younis, according to the applicant, kept asking the applicant to sign for the parcel and eventually he agreed. His account was that he did so in order to prevent his uncle or his cousins from being shot, believing what his uncle had told him. He picked up the parcel because he believed that otherwise the lives of Younis and his children would be in danger.
18. In cross-examination the applicant made a number of concessions. He agreed that, having studied police methods and procedure at university, his first instinct on hearing about the threat to his uncle was to go to the police because they would be able to help. Asked why he did not himself go to the police at that stage, he could not explain. He said, ""I don't know"". He agreed that at the time when he agreed to sign for the parcel he was not himself under any threat of violence. He agreed that Younis was not under any threat of immediate violence at that time either. The threat of harm to Younis and his children would only be carried out if and when the parcel was not signed for. He accepted that on 17
th
and 18
th
October, despite believing that the lives of his uncle and cousins depended on him, he had left Bahar on his own on Fentham Road for long periods of time, including a visit to the shop to buy some chips and one to his grandmother's.
19. At the close of this evidence Mr Gottlieb, who appeared for the applicant at the trial as he does today, conceded that on the applicant's own account all the elements of the offence charged were made out, but submitted that the defence of duress could be left to the jury. Mr Hankin QC, for the Crown, resisted that submission. Mr Gottlieb submitted to the judge that the evidence of his client, or the effect of it was that he had believed that if he went to the police then his uncle or his uncle's children would be killed. The judge indicated that he did not believe that this was the true state of the evidence. Mr Gottlieb responded that in that case ""the answer would be to apply for leave to recall my client and he could be asked simply to clarify what is really being said"". The judge replied, ""No. He is not going to get a second chance about this"". It was that response which originally formed one of the grounds of appeal, which has not been pursued today, as we have said.
20. We turn, therefore, to the judge's ruling on the defence of duress. The classic statement of the law in this area is that of Lord Lane CJ in
R v Graham (Paul Anthony)
[1982] 1 WLR 294. There are two questions: the first is whether the defendant was or may have been ""impelled to act as he did because as a result of what he reasonably believed [the threatener] had said or done, he had good cause to fear that if he did not so act [the threatener] would kill him or cause him serious physical injury"". The principle has since been extended to cover threats to kill or injure members of the defendant's family. It has never been disputed in this case that a threat to the applicant's uncle is capable of founding a defence of duress.
21. If the answer to the first question is ""Yes"", the second question arises. It is this: whether the prosecution have ""made the jury sure that a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the defendant, would not have responded to whatever he reasonably believed [the threatener] said or did by taking part [in the offence]"".
22. The legal principles, including those limiting the scope of the defence were authoritatively re-stated by Lord Bingham in
R v Z
[2005] UKHL 22
,
[2005] 2 AC 467
. The defence and its application have been reviewed in a number of decisions of this court, including:
R v Bianco
[2001] EWCA Crim 2516
,
R v Batchelor
[2013] EWCA Crim 2638
,
R v Hammond
[2013] EWCA Crim 2709
, and
R v Brandford
[2017] 1 Cr App R 14
. These cases were all cited and considered in the careful written reasons of Judge Drew QC. It is enough for present purposes to identify the following six points, which are reflected in the judge's ruling and are not controversial:
1. There is strong objective element in the defence reflected in, among other things, the test of what a sober person of reasonable firmness would do: see
Brandford
at [32] and
Z
at [21(4)].
2. There is the question of whether evasive action could have been taken. Lord Bingham put it this way at [21(6)]:
""The defendant may excuse his criminal conduct on grounds of duress only if, placed as he was, there was no evasive action he could reasonably have been expected to take… This is an important limitation of the duress defence …""
3. The threat must carry immediacy; otherwise, a defendant may find it impossible to dispute his ability to take evasive action: see
Brandford
at [33]. In
Z
Lord Bingham said at [28] this:
""… if the retribution threatened against the defendant or his family … is not such as he reasonably expects to follow immediately or almost immediately on his failure to comply with the threat, there may be little, if any, room for doubt that he could have taken evasive action, whether by going to the police or in some other way to avoid committing the crime with which he is charged.""
4. Where a defence of duress is raised, the burden lies on the prosecution to disprove it to the criminal standard of proof:
Brandford
at [36].
5. Ordinarily, it will be for the jury to decide whether the prosecution has succeeded in this task. This court as warned that there is a thin line between cases where a judge is entitled to withdraw the defence from the jury and those where, on the other hand, he or she impermissibly reaches a conclusion on the facts and thus usurps the fact-finding role of the jury: see
Hammond
at [6].
6. Judges do, however, have a responsibility to make rulings of law. The judge should exercise caution. But if the case is one in which the evidence fails to raise an arguable basis for a duress defence and no reasonable jury could conclude that the defence is or may be available, the judge is entitled – indeed he would be right – to withdraw the defence from the jury's consideration. The constitutional function of the jury does not include a right to reach perverse conclusions: see
Bianco
at [15],
Batchelor
at [16] to [19] and
Brandford
[37] to [38].
23. In this case the judge identified two key questions that arose on the evidence. The first was whether the threat was an immediate one (""the immediacy issue""). The second was whether it would have been possible for the applicant to take evasive action (""the evasion issue""). In the judge's view, these were separate and distinct questions. Having reviewed the authorities, the judge concluded that, in principle, in determining whether a reasonable person of the applicant's age and background may have been driven or forced to act as he did, the jury should consider:
(1) whether or not the threat would be carried out immediately or almost immediately. If they are sure it would not be, then the defence cannot arise;
(2) whether there was any evasive action open to the applicant in order to avoid committing the crime. If they are sure that there was, then the defence cannot arise.
24. Having reminded himself of the words of warning to be found in the authorities, the judge concluded, nonetheless, that he should withdraw the defence from the jury. So far as the immediacy issue is concerned, he reasoned that the time at which the applicant had first become a participant in the criminal conduct was when he agreed to sign for the parcel. At that time the threat in existence was not one which any properly directed jury could find was immediate or almost immediate. It was a conditional threat which would only ever be carried out at some future time. It was not enough to say that there was a threat that if the parcel was not signed for there would be immediate violence.
25. Further, or alternatively, the judge reasoned that any reasonable jury would be bound to resolve the evasion issue against the applicant. On his own account, once he agreed to sign for the parcel and therefore became knowingly concerned in the importation, he could have taken avoiding action, and he knew it, but he failed to do so. The judge went on to observe that the applicant's failure to go to the police, or even alert or consult family members, continued for at least a week after his first engagement in the exercise and that during that period he carried out a series of further acts in furtherance of the importation.
26. Mr Gottlieb challenges both limbs of the judge's ruling. He submits that the jury might have concluded that the applicant had acted under duress of circumstances if it accepted that his evidence was true. The submission is that the judge failed properly to evaluate the applicant's evidence, of which he did not have a transcript, about the nature of the threat and the reasons that he could not go to the police. As a result, it is submitted that the judge reached the wrong conclusions on both issues. The way the matter has been put in argument today is that the main issue is whether the learned judge properly appreciated that there was evidence from the applicant capable of amounting to an explanation as to why he failed to contact the police.
27. We take the view that the judge's approach to the imminence issue was, at least on the unusual facts of this case, an entirely sound one. We do not regard the judge's evidential analysis as arguably flawed. On no view of the evidence was the violence that had been threatened immediate or close to immediate at the time of the applicant's agreement to participate in the importation. There was a gap in time of at least a week between the engagement in the crime and the earliest time at which the threat might be put into effect.
28. But whatever might be said about the judge's approach to the imminence issue, we are quite certain that he reached the right conclusion on the evasion issue. With the assistance of Mr Gottlieb and Mr Hankin QC for the Crown, we have looked carefully at the transcript of the applicant's evidence. We have not been persuaded that the applicant's evidence can be read as indicating that he, as opposed to his uncle, believed that if the police were approached, that would lead to his uncle or cousins being killed. We do not see in the applicant's evidence anything capable of amounting to an explanation of why, as a matter of fact, he did not see fit to approach the police.
29. But even if that were wrong, as the authorities emphasise, the test is not (or not only) a subjective one. The applicant had spent four years studying police procedure. He offered no explanation for failing to approach the police. On the evidence in this case there was only one possible answer to the second question posed by Lord Lane CJ, namely that the sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the applicant, would not have been driven to commit the crime. He would have taken evasive action by going to the police or perhaps in some other way: for instance, by involving family members. No reasonable jury could have reached a different conclusion, in our judgment. The judge stayed firmly on the right side of the line between usurping the role of the jury and the proper exercise of the judicial function.
30. For those reasons the application is refused.

Approved Judgment
1.
John Gregson is 34. On 27
th
August 2020 at the Crown Court in Birmingham for an offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Persons Act 1861 he was sentenced to a community order of 3 years duration with a rehabilitation activity requirement of 30 days and a 6 months alcohol treatment requirement. The victim surcharge was payable.
2.
The respondent had been convicted on 20 February 2020 after a trial before HHJ Henderson. The Attorney General applies to refer the sentence to this court under section 36 of the CJA 1988 on the grounds that it is unduly lenient. We give leave.
3.
We take our account of the facts from the reference save where the judge made specific findings. To the extent that they conflict with the reference we rely on the judge’s findings which he made to the requisite standard.
4.
The offence took place on 7 April 2019. The victim was Gaspar Tairo. The two men had been friends for years. They had spent the evening together and ended up drinking at the home of Gaspar Tairo with other people. One of the other people owed the respondent money and went home to get it. He did not return. The respondent became agitated. He was later to say that he had also lent Tairo £40 and became very angry when he realised that Tairo was using it to buy crack cocaine. The respondent became aggressive and started a fight with the victim. The two men exchanged blows. The respondent was shouting threats. At one point he picked up a bottle and brought it down onto the back of Tairo’s head causing a wound, which was the basis of the count on the indictment. The wound bled profusely.
5.
The noise of the altercation caused a neighbour to call the police. The respondent ran away before they arrived. He was arrested and interviewed on 6 July. He denied causing any injuries to the victim, saying he had run away after an argument about the crack cocaine, the victim having attacked him. He maintained his account at trial and was disbelieved.
6.
The victim sustained a 4cm laceration to the back of the head with an associated minor head injury. There were some superficial lacerations to the victim’s face and other minor soft tissue injuries.
7.
The judge found that a single blow with the intact bottle had caused the laceration and had caused the bottle to break. He specifically rejected the suggestion that the respondent had used the bottle after breaking it. He referred to the medical evidence which supported his analysis. He continued, “Although the pictures are not at all clear there’s nothing to suggest…that this was a glassing in any sense and it doesn’t seem to me that I could be sure there was more than one blow with the bottle and that being the one that broke it.”
8.
The respondent had 6 previous convictions, none relevant to this offence. The most recent offence was in 2016. 5 were for summary driving offences, including drink driving. He had no convictions for any form of violence.
9.
The respondent had been in stable employment for years. His employer had sent a supportive reference. There was before the court a presentence report and a psychiatric report which the judge had sought in the light of the respondent’s obvious problems with alcohol. During the course of the trial it had become clear that the defendant’s drinking had begun while he was a serving soldier and after he had seen active service in Afghanistan.
10.
According to the pre sentence report the respondent was born and brought up in Zambia and educated at boarding school. He came to this country at the age of 18 and joined the army. He was posted to Helmand province in Afghanistan and served in a fire fighting unit. During a period in 2007 his unit lost a lot of men. He did not sustain any major injuries but had struggled for years with the psychological effect of a grenade attack on his unit. Some of his fellow soldiers were shockingly injured. It is not necessary to set out the details of what the respondent experienced as he sought to assist his fellow soldiers. It is sufficient to record that we have read his harrowing account. He currently suffers from flashbacks disturbed sleep and nightmares and reexperienced those events.
11.
He began drinking to cope with his experiences. When back in the United Kingdom he was regularly drinking to excess. He had pleaded guilty on two occasions within three months of driving with excess alcohol. As a result he was discharged from the army.
12.
The probation officer identified that drinking was at the heart of the offence. He said that at that time he was drinking vodka and cider daily. At the time of the offence he had drunk about a bottle of vodka. He remembered the fight but did not remember hitting his friend over the head with a bottle. The respondent was remorseful, having accepted his guilt. He was empathetic towards the victim. The probation officer assessed him as at low risk of reoffending. The focus of the report to the court was the need for the respondent to deal with and overcome his drinking. Whilst acknowledging the likelihood of a custodial sentence the recommendation was for a long Community Order to give sufficient time to address the problems with requirements for unpaid work, an alcohol treatment requirement and a rehabilitation activity requirement.
13.
The psychiatrist also supported an Alcohol Treatment requirement. He diagnosed mental and behavioural disorders due to harmful use of alcohol (ICD 10 F10-1) and found the account of nightmares and flashbacks met the criteria for reaction to severe stress, unspecified. It was his view that alcohol was clouding any other potential underlying diagnosis.
14.
Mr Mann who appeared for the respondent at trial and before us began his mitigation with a reminder to the judge of the provisions of Section 125(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act of 2009 and submitted that it was not in the interests of justice to impose a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the sentencing council guideline for an offence of wounding with intent contrary to section 18.
15.
In response to this submission the judge said he would think first about the guideline. Before turning to the detail he described the incident thus “As I say, my view is this is a drunken fight between two friends. One of them picks a bottle up and whacks the other one over the head with it and it causes a classic head cut that bleeds like mad but is in no sense any serious injury in terms of the range for a section 18.” He said that he could persuade himself that the case came within category 3 or the borderline of 2
and 3 and recognised that applying the guideline the shortest sentence of imprisonment would be more than 2 years and so could not be suspended (by reason of the suspended sentence guideline). 16.
He went on to say “looking at the defendant, a bit of trouble but no violence before. Although not a diagnosed PTSD plainly I’ve no reason to doubt what he says about the experiences he had serving his country and I’ve no reason to doubt the flashbacks and all the rest of it that he describes and that he chose, as so many people do, a completely inappropriate but understandable coping mechanism and he managed to control himself for many years having gone through that, having drunk too much for a long time.” He went on to comment that the effect of a 16 month delay from the events to sentence was that he was able to show that there had been no repeat of the behaviour, however worrying that extended wait had been.
17.
The judge said towards the end of mitigation that he was prepared to be persuaded by Mr Mann that “what’s in the PSR is probably in the particular circumstances of this case the proper way of dealing with it.” At that point, if not before, it was clear that the judge was going to step outside the sentencing guidelines.
18.
In his sentencing remarks the judge said “You are 34 years old. As we know from everything that we’ve read you served this country in the army for some time and …you were faced with at least one terrible event. I am not surprised to find that it has carried on affecting you, as it does with many people who go through these events not everyone does because it is a lottery whether it affects you or not, but it plainly has in your case. You chose to deal with it in a foolish way but understandably... not facing up to it trying to mask it by drinking too much.
19.
He repeated his assessment that this was a drunken fight, that the respondent had picked up the bottle and used it once only. He told the defendant that he would have been facing a sentence of several years for this offence “particularly not helped by the fact that you did not face up to it at the trial but in all the particular circumstances of this offence bearing in mind as well the long delay and the fact that you have not reoffended I am just persuaded that it is appropriate to make the order that I am asked to do.”
20.
He continued, “the effect is in real terms that this is a suspended sentence because if you break this order you will be brought back and any breach will come before me if I am available and I will send you to prison for a significant length of time”
The AG’s submissions
21.
A number of points made in the written reference were not developed in argument before us and there is no need to refer to them. Mr Jarvis put the case before us with characteristic focus and clarity.
22.
He first developed an argument to the effect that the judge must have had in mind a sentence of 4 or 5 years given the passage of the sentencing remarks to which we refer at paragraphs 18-20 above. He submitted that it was “difficult to unpick the sentencing remarks” to understand how he ended up with a community order. We disagree.
23.
Taking the sentencing hearing as a whole it is clear that the judge first gave consideration to the guideline (see paragraph 15 above). Having concluded that following the guideline would lead to a longer sentence than he could properly suspend he did not, as some may have done, seek artificially to reduce the sentence to 2 years so that he could suspend it. He recognised that he either followed the guideline or he did not. That was a principled approach.
24.
Mr Jarvis submitted that the judge did not explain why he was taking such an unusual course. He said that the judge did not engage with the interests of justice test in his sentencing remarks but he was careful to add that he was not saying that the judge had not applied the appropriate test – rather that he had not explained it. Whilst the judge did not say in terms that he considered it in the interests of justice to depart from the guideline, any fair and balanced reading of the sentencing hearing and the sentencing remarks which he addressed in somewhat conversational terms to the defendant, leads to the clear conclusion that he was departing from the guideline to achieve a just sentence in this case namely a Community Sentence.
25.
Mr Jarvis drew to our attention that there was no punitive element in the sentence which he submits renders it unlawful. We agree.
26.
By Section 177(2A) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 ,where the court makes a community order, the court must - (a) include in the order at least one requirement imposed for the purpose of punishment, or (b) impose a fine for the offence in respect of which the community order is made, or (c) comply with both of paragraphs (a) and
(b).
27.
The court did none of these. By operation of subsection (2B), subsection (2A) does not apply where there are exceptional circumstances which (a) relate to the offence or to the offender, (b) would make it unjust in all the circumstances for the court to comply with subsection (2A)(a) in the particular case, and (c) would make it unjust in all the circumstances for the court to impose a fine for the offence concerned
28.
We do not consider that any of the exceptional circumstances in Section 177(2B) were satisfied in this case. It is unfortunate that these provisions were not drawn to the attention of the judge leading him to impose a sentence which was unlawful and, in the absence of punishment, unduly lenient.
29.
As we have already said the probation officer had recommended unpaid work, notwithstanding that the respondent was in full time employment and the respondent was prepared to undertake such work. He still is. The recommendation was appropriate. The reason the judge did not impose an unpaid work requirement is clear from the exchanges during the hearing namely that there was no possibility at that time of unpaid work being offered because of the effects of the Covid 19 pandemic. It was not pointed out to the judge (as it should have been) that there was no barrier to ordering unpaid work so that it could be carried out within 12 months of the making of the order, as and when such work became available. That course should have been taken here. Since August, increasing amounts of unpaid work have become available. We would expect that to continue, subject inevitably, to some interruptions as the Probation Service copes with the changing and difficult situation.
30.
But even had the judge imposed an unpaid work requirement the position of the Attorney General would have remained the same. Distilled to its essential component Mr Jarvis’ submission was that there was nothing about the offence or the defendant which the judge could properly have relied on in coming to a decision that it was not in the interests of justice to follow the guidelines in this case and impose a sentence of immediate imprisonment. We disagree.
31.
It was accepted by prosecuting counsel at trial and by Mr Jarvis that there was a connection between the respondent’s experiences in Afghanistan and the offence. The judge was clearly deeply affected by the respondent’s account of what had happened and placed significant emphasis upon the fact that the trauma the respondent experienced was in the service of our country. Military service even in the most difficult conditions does not lead automatically to lenient sentencing for crimes committed later in life. Much depends on the circumstances of the case. The judge had read a great deal about the respondent and had observed him throughout the trial. That, taken with the other features to which we have already referred led him to conclude that a lengthy prison sentence would be unjust.
32.
We were provided with an updated report from a different probation officer. The respondent has responded well to the community order, maintaining contacts and engaging in discussions with his probation officer. He is still working and has cut down his drinking. He is ready willing and able to engage with the Alcohol Treatment team and it is highly regrettable that he is still waiting for his first appointment three months after the order was made. We are told that this is to be escalated by Probation to the provider’s managers. It hardly needs to be said that delay in treatment of this sort is fraught with danger. We would expect this issue to be resolved swiftly. The probation officer suggests that an Alcohol Treatment order of 12 months duration would have a better prospect of success than the current 6 months order.
33.
It is very rare that following the sentencing guidelines will be contrary to the interests of justice. This very experienced judge had time before sentence to reflect and approached the sentencing exercise in a principled fashion. We are not persuaded that he was wrong to conclude that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the sentencing guideline on the particular facts of the case before him. Nor, in the context of such facts, was he wrong to pass a Community Order, provided that it included the necessary punitive element.
34.
The sentence was unlawful by reason of the absence of a punitive element and was therefore unduly lenient and we quash it. We replace it with a three year Community Order starting from the date of sentence and a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement of 30 days from date of sentence. There will also be an unpaid work requirement of 200 hours and an alcohol treatment requirement of 12 months from today.","citation:

LORD JUSTICE SIMON:
1.
The Solicitor General seeks leave to refer to this court a sentence passed on the offender in the Crown Court at Maidstone under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 as being unduly lenient.
2.
On 13 March 2018, the offender, aged 26, pleaded guilty on a full facts basis to a charge of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861. On 14 May, he was sentenced by Mr Recorder Gallagher to a term of 4 years' imprisonment.
3.
During the early hours of Saturday, 26 August 2017, Daniel Broadley, the victim of the assault, was with his friend, Joe Steadman, at the Red Lion pub at Northfleet, Gravesend. He went into the pub to buy a drink, leaving Mr Steadman outside. When he returned, Mr Steadman was engaged in a heated conversation with a man called Luke Silver. The offender was there too. Mr Broadley had previously met him through mutual friends. The offender was encouraging Mr Steadman and Mr Silver, saying to Mr Silver, ""Hit him, hit him"". Mr Broadley said to the offender, ""Don't stir them up, just let them have their conversation"". A crowd of people formed around Mr Broadley and at some point he was pushed in the chest by someone he did not know. The incident that followed was captured on CCTV footage, which this court has seen.
4.
The offender walked around the back of the crowd and up to Mr Broadley. He had a bottle in his raised left hand from which he had been drinking a few minutes earlier. He used the bottle as a weapon upended to strike towards Mr Broadley. The first strike missed him and instead came into contact with the head of one of his friends, who was knocked sideways. Mr Broadley faced the offender, who immediately launched his left hand and struck him in the face with the bottle. He felt a thud and put his hands up in an attempt to cover and protect his face. He can be seen trying to get away to a red car. However, the offender continued to assault him, punching him twice. Mr Silver attempted to bring the assault to an end. However, Mr Broadley fell to the ground and the offender then used his left and right hands to punch Mr Broadley to the head. The CCTV footage shows a total of five strikes to Mr Broadley whilst he was on the ground. Another man then intervened and pushed the offender away and a group came to Mr Broadley's aid. The incident lasted approximately 10 to 11 seconds.
5.
The offender returned a short time later and said to his victim, ""You tried to hit me first but I'm just too fast for you so I hit you first"". He was smirking when he said this. Mr Broadley was tearful and said, ""I have to go home and see my kids like this. I have to see my family like this and I haven't done fuck all wrong"". Police and paramedics attended the scene.
6.
Mr Broadley was taken to Darenth Valley Hospital, where a triangular shaped cut to the right side of his forehead was treated with two stitches. Redness had formed over his right eye and swelling over his right cheek, but no abnormalities were noted on the CT scan and he was then discharged.
7.
Three days later, he went to A&E at Milton Keynes University Hospital reporting headaches, nausea and discharge from his nose. Further, his nose was clicking in and out of place and he had decreased sensation in the right side of his face with bruising around his eyes. A CT scan revealed fractures to his right eye orbit, right cheekbone and nose. Mr Broadley refers to chipped teeth too. He photographed his injuries, which this court has seen.
8.
On 22 September, the offender was interviewed. A legal representative was present. He was asked question about the incident and was shown CCTV footage. He answered no comment to all questions asked. On 31 January 2018, he was charged by way of a postal requisition with section 18 wounding.
9.
It is clear from the victim personal statement of Mr Broadley that the assault had an impact on him emotionally, physically and socially, and has affected his ability to work. At first he felt stressed and angry because the incident made him feel that he was unable to look after himself, and the appearance of his facial injuries was such that he felt too embarrassed to see his family, including his children and friends. The incident caused him a lot of emotional stress in the relationship with his partner. He was already suffering from depression when the incident happened and became more depressed. His partner was unable to deal with this depression. The incident also had an impact on his ability to work. He had to take time off, and spent two weeks in a mental health centre. He lost two and a half weeks' wages through his inability to work.
10.
The offender had no previous convictions, although he had a caution for common assault in 2011 when he was aged 19.
11.
On 13 February 2018, he attended the Medway Magistrates' Court, where the case was sent to Maidstone Crown Court. He indicated a guilty plea and was remanded on unconditional bail.
12.
On 13 March 2018, at the plea and trial preparation hearing, he was arraigned and pleaded guilty to the section 18 charge. Sentence was adjourned for a psychiatric report and the offender was remanded on conditional bail; (residence and to attend an appointment with the psychiatric expert as arranged by his instructing solicitor).
13.
On 14 May 2018, the case was listed for sentence. Prior to this hearing the recorder received written submissions on behalf of the prosecution summarising the facts and highlighting the relevance and application of the assault definitive guidelines. Two further documents were placed before him in support of the offender's plea and mitigation. The first was a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Sajeela Karim dated 14 May 2018. This provided background information, a psychiatric history recording alcohol and substance abuse, self-harm and a tendency to act impulsively and without consideration of the consequences. The offender's symptoms were, in the view of Dr Karim, suggestive of traits of emotionally unstable personality disorder. He did not, however, suffer from a mental disorder of the nature and degree to require treatment in hospital. Nor did he show any evidence of a severe and enduring mental illness which would benefit from psychiatric treatment under supervision. The second was a letter from Mr D Kmita of Kmita Motors. He spoke to the offender's good character and positive work ethic.
14.
The recorder sentenced the offender on the following basis. That it was a wholly unprovoked attack against a defenceless man. There was some degree of premeditation since he deliberately walked around the back of Mr Broadley before striking. He used a bottle as a weapon. It was a sustained attack. More than one blow was inflicted. The strike had missed Mr Broadley and hit another man. The second strike made contact, and he then continued to assault his victim, having knocked him to the ground. There were repeated punches whilst the victim was on the ground. There was a wound requiring stitches and fractures to the right eye orbit, the right cheek and to his nose and he also suffered chipped teeth. The recorder referred to the impact on the victim, and expressed the view that the dangerousness criteria were not met.
15.
Applying the definitive guidelines, he determined the case fell on the cusp of category 1 and category 2. The starting point for category 1 was 12 years' imprisonment with a range of 9 to 16 years. The starting point for category 2 was 6 years' imprisonment with a range of 5 to 9 years. The recorder identified a starting point of 6 years' imprisonment and reduced the sentence by 2 years to 4 years' imprisonment to reflect the full credit for the plea of guilty.
16.
For the Solicitor General, Ms Pattison submits that in terms of harm this was a sustained and repeated attack, but she concedes that although serious in personal terms to Mr Broadley, the physical and psychological harm was not serious in the context of the offence. As to culpability, there was the use of the bottle to cause the serious harm. There were in addition a number of aggravating features: the targeting of the victim, the location and timing of the offence (an unprovoked attack outside a public house in the early hours of the morning) and the continuing effect of the crime on the victim. She also acknowledges the mitigation available: the offender's background and struggles with mental health issues, his lack of previous convictions, his remorse and his plea. She submits that the recorder was right to place this offending on the cusp of category 1 and 2 but that the sentence did not reflect that assessment and that a sentence of 6 years before credit for the plea did not reflect the seriousness of the offence.
17.
For the offender, Ms Cotcher QC submits that this offending was properly characterised as one of lesser harm. It was not a sustained attack in the sense envisaged by the guidelines and the harm was not so serious as to justify greater harm being found. This was, she submitted, a category 2 offence: lesser harm but greater culpability because of the use of the bottle. However, she submits that the bottle was not broken, although she recognised that it was used as a weapon.
18.
The recorder had seen a very full and clear psychiatric report from Dr Karim which included material information. He had been the victim of physical abuse from his father and bullying as a child. He had witnessed domestic violence at his home. He had begun to have live issues with his mental health coinciding in part with his father's death about 3 years before. He had made a number of suicide attempts over the past years, matters to which we will come shortly. He had suffered from paranoia, hallucinations and anxiety, as well as drug dependency and the excess use of alcohol.
19.
She draws attention to the fact that in the period between August 2017, the offence date, and May 2018, the sentence date, a period of 9 months, he had sought help from mental health authorities and taken a number of steps, including voluntary admission to the Littlebrook Secure Psychiatric Hospital in Dartford, to address his problems. He had initially approached the liaison psychiatric team 3 days after trying to hang himself. There had been other attempts at suicide in October and November and by March 2018 there was still reference to suicidal thoughts. Ms Cotcher submits that this showed a firm commitment by the offender to attempt to solve problems that led to what was an entirely out of character offence and this resolution, she submits, continues in custody, as is clear from the reports.
20.
The psychiatric report notes the offender's reaction when viewing the CCTV image of the incident: it made him ""disgusted"" and he said, ""I panicked, I was disgusted I'd done it"". She draws attention to the fact that since the date of sentence he has spent much of his time in custody on suicide watch. That information comes from the offender himself, the offender supervision report and, most recently, staff at Rochester Prison.
21.
The recorder treated the offender as a man of entirely good character and agreed that the offence was out of character, and Ms Cotchen submits that there are many mitigating factors identified in the guidelines which are present in this case. Apart from his good character, it was an isolated incident and he had shown remorse. The offender told the psychiatrist, ""I accept what I did was wrong"" and that he was feeling guilty for the negative impact he had had on the victim's life. Nevertheless, she accepts that this was a lenient sentence, although she submits that it was not unduly so in the light of the highly unusual circumstances to which she has drawn the court's attention.
22.
We start by observing that this was a despicable crime. The victim was subjected to an entirely unprovoked assault. The offender initially used a bottle as a weapon to inflict the injury before laying about the victim with his fists while he was on the ground. This was an offence of higher culpability within the meaning of the Sentencing Council definitive guidelines on assault.
23.
We are not, however, persuaded that there were factors indicating greater harm. As we have said, we have seen the recording of the crime recorded on the CCTV image and serious as the assault was, it lasted no more than 11 seconds from start to finish. We do not regard this as a sustained and repeated assault such as to bring it into the category of greater harm in the guidelines.
24.
The assault caused the victim both physical and, as is often the case with this type of crime, longer-lasting mental harm. But these have to be assessed by reference to the nature of the crime charged under section 18. In our view, the nature of the assault and the injuries caused both justified an upward adjustment within the category 2 range, lesser harm and greater culpability, rather than elevating the offence into category 1 or placing it on the cusp of category 1 and 2.
25.
The starting point for a category 2 offence is a term of 6 years' imprisonment but these two factors, as well as the location and timing of the offence, the commission of the offence while drunk and the continuing effect of the crime on the victim, would have elevated the starting point.
26.
On the other side of the sentencing balance were his effective good character, his troubled background and his continuing mental health difficulties, which he was trying to address, as well as his clearly expressed remorse.
27.
The sentence in fact imposed was a sentence of 4 years. In our view, this was a lenient sentence. However, in the circumstances we have described, we do not regard it as unduly lenient. It follows that although we grant leave to refer, we decline to interfere with this sentence, which will remain a sentence of 4 years' imprisonment.","citation:

(Approved)
1.
LADY JUSTICE MACUR:  On 9 January 2015, the applicant was sentenced in the Crown Court to 20 months’ imprisonment and made subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (“SOPO”) for a period of 10 years.  The facts of his offending leading to that sentence are irrelevant for the purpose of this appeal.
2.
On 12 January 2019, the applicant pleaded guilty, before the Magistrates’ Court, to five offences of breach of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, contrary to section 103(1) and (3) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and two offences of failure to comply with notification requirements, contrary to section 91(1)A and (2) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  He was committed to the Crown Court for sentence, pursuant to section 3 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.  Again, the particulars of the breaches laid against the applicant are now irrelevant for the purpose of this application.
3.
On 8 March 2019, he was sentenced in the Crown Court to 18 months’ imprisonment concurrent on all offences.  The statutory surcharge was imposed and the SOPO was revoked and an “SHPO” (a Sexual Harm Prevention Order) was imposed for a period of 10 years and included additional conditions to those imposed in the original SOPO.
4.
The five breach offences each correctly described in the SOPO were charged as
“contrary to section 103(1) and (3)”
of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, when they should have been charged as
contrary to section 113
of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, since on 8 March 2015 section 113 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was repealed by section 113 and paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 5 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.  At the same time, paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 introduced sexual harm prevention orders by inserting sections 103A-103K into the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the breach of which would be an offence contrary to section 103L of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
5.
On 24 March 2022, the applicant was charged with a breach of the SHPO contrary to section 103(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and remanded in custody.  Again, the particulars of the breaches laid against the applicant are now irrelevant to this application.  He was committed to the Crown Court in advance of the plea and trial preparation hearing.  The designated judge alerted the prosecution to potential flaws in the proceedings, indicating that a sexual harm prevention order cannot be imposed for breach offences, since they do not fall within Schedules 3 and 5 of the Sexual Offences Act.
6.
The case was listed before the Recorder of Manchester on 1 July 2022.  The prosecution conceded that the Order was unlawful and offered no evidence, leading to the applicant’s immediate release from custody.  That is, the inevitable conclusion to be drawn was that the judge, in March 2019, had no power to revoke the SOPO.  New counsel were instructed (Miss Greenhalgh) and thereafter sought permission to appeal the sentence passed in March 2019.
7.
The sole ground of appeal, conceded by the prosecution in a Respondent’s Notice, is that there was no power for the Crown Court to make the sexual harm prevention order, which might only have been made if the applicant had been convicted of an offence listed in Schedule 3 or 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  Neither breaches of a SOPO nor failing to comply with the notification provisions are so listed.  It was said that the court could only vary the SOPO if application was made by the applicant or by a prescribed Chief Officer of Police, pursuant to section 108(1) and (2) of the Sexual Offences Act.  However, it was noted that the applicant did not submit that the charging error was other than a mere technical defect which did not render the charges a nullity.
Determination
8.
We extend time in which to make this application, for it is in the interests of justice to do so.  As rightly indicated in the grounds of appeal and conceded in the Respondent’s Notice, as originally enacted, a breach of a SOPO was an offence contrary to section 113 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  On 8 March 2015, section 113 of the 2003 Act was repealed by section 113 and paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 5 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.  Transitional provisions provided by section 114 of that Act, provided that for a period of 5 years from the commencement date, that is a period of 5 years from 8 March 2015, any breach of a SOPO, made under section 104 of the 2003 Act (as was the SOPO in this case) would still be an offence contrary to section 113 of that Act.  If the SOPO remains in force after 8 March 2020 (as here), section 103L of the 2003 Act would have effect.  The charges in this case were brought before 8 March 2020; it follows that the applicant should have been charged with the offences contrary to section 113.
9.
A legal error made in the formulation of charges, whether arising from a drafting or administrative error which causes no prejudice or embarrassment to the defendant, will not result in those charges being invalid or a nullity (see
R v Stocker
[2014] 1 Cr App R 18, at paragraphs 42 and 45) and
R v Sheldrake
[2023] EWCA Crim 95, at paragraph 16.  That notwithstanding, the judge in March 2019 had no power to revoke the SOPO, as indicated above.  An application to discharge a SOPO must, in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 31, be made by either the defendant or a Chief Officer of Police (see
R v Hamer
[2017] 2 Cr App R(S) 13 at paragraph 21;
R v Ashford
[2020] 2 Cr App R(S) 57 at paragraph 18 and also
R v Keywood
[2021] EWCA Crim 1692).
10.
We give leave.  We allow the appeal.  We quash the Order revoking the SOPO and the substitution of the Sexual Prevention Harm Order.  Therefore, the SOPO will be revived (see
R v Keywood
(supra)).  If appropriate, it will of course be open to a Chief Officer of Police or by the Director General of the National Crime Agency to make applications to the Magistrates’ Court for a Sexual Harm Prevention Order against a qualifying offender, who has acted in such as to give reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for such an Order to be made (see section 103A(3)-(7) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003).   To that extent, this appeal succeeds and we may therefore release Miss Greenhalgh and Mr Evans, but thanks for your attendance.
Epiq Europe Ltd hereby certify that the above is an accurate and complete record of the proceedings or part thereof.

    Comment: Crown Court should not have revoked the SOPO and replace it with a SHPO
    Exact: A legal error made in the formulation of charges, whether arising from a drafting or administrative error which causes no prejudice or embarrassment to the defendant, will not result in those charges being invalid or a nullity (see R v Stocker [2014] 1 Cr App R 18, at paragraphs 42 and 45) and R v Sheldrake [2023] EWCA Crim 95, at paragraph 16.  That notwithstanding, the judge in March 2019 had no power to revoke the SOPO, as indicated above.  An application to discharge a SOPO must, in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 31, be made by either the defendant or a Chief Officer of Police (see R v Hamer [2017] 2 Cr App R(S) 13 at paragraph 21; R v Ashford [2020] 2 Cr App R(S) 57 at paragraph 18 and also R v Keywood [2021] EWCA Crim 1692).  10.Copy link to this paragraphWe give leave.  We allow the appeal.  We quash the Order revoking the SOPO and the substitution of the Sexual Prevention Harm Order.  Therefore, the SOPO will be revived (see R v Keywood (supra)).  If appropriate, it will of course be open to a Chief Officer of Police or by the Director General of the National Crime Agency to make applications to the Magistrates’ Court for a Sexual Harm Prevention Order against a qualifying offender, who has acted in such as to give reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for such an Order to be made (see section 103A(3)-(7) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003).   To that extent, this appeal succeeds and we may therefore release Miss Greenhalgh and Mr Evans, but thanks for your attendance.

J U D G M E N T
LORD JUSTICE TOULSON:
I shall ask Mr Justice Davis to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE DAVIS:
1. The applicant is now aged 19. On 8 February 2011 at the Crown Court at Woolwich he pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to affray. On 11 March 2011 he was sentenced to a term of six months' detention in a young offender institution. His application for leave to appeal against sentence has been referred by the Registrar to the full court.
2. There were a number of co-accused. Two, O'Brien and Cowling, pleaded guilty to counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm and affray and were sentenced to twelve months' detention in a young offender institution. Three others, Robinson, Strugnell and Murphy, pleaded guilty on re-arraignment to affray and received the same sentence as the applicant, that is six months' detention in a young offender institution.
3. The background facts can be very shortly stated for present purposes. The applicant had been to a night club in the O2 area of East London with his co-accused. He left the club with a number of them at around 4am on 7 March 2010. They joined up with two others who had been with them earlier that evening and went to buy some food. They then made their way to a bus stop. There were two students at the bus stop. One of them objected when one of the members of the applicant's group started to urinate on the pavement. The group went over and started to remonstrate with the student. He was kicked and punched by members of the group. His friend sought to intervene. The applicant joined in the ensuing fight after, he said, he was punched by one of the complainants. He struck at one and kicked out at another. During the course of the fight the first student was also head-butted. He was subsequently taken to hospital, where he was treated for fractures to the medial wall and floor of the left orbit. His friend sustained a cut to the chin.
4. After the attack had finished, the group walked off. A bus driver refused to let them board his bus. The police were summoned. The members of the group were found in the area and were arrested.
5. When he was interviewed, the applicant admitted becoming involved in the melee and said that he was very drunk at the time.
6. The applicant has no previous convictions of any kind. Indeed, there was documentation indicating positive good character.
7. The sentencing judge had before him a very detailed and thorough pre-sentence report which indicates that the applicant appeared genuinely shocked and empathised with the position of the victims. In dealing with his personal circumstances the pre-sentence report states:
""With reference to [the applicant's] education and employment achievements, the [applicant] tells me that he left secondary education with nine GCSEs and an A level in food technology. [The applicant] states that he began an electrical engineering course at Bexley college but left in his first year due to being in fear for his safety having been the victim of a robbery in that area. In terms of employment the [applicant] stated that he has a limited work history due to his age but has previously worked as a pipe fitter at Harrods. At present [the applicant] is a registered full-time carer for his mother who suffers from epilepsy and has provided further evidence to support this in the form of Department of Work and Pensions payments. Furthermore, the [applicant] also stated that his father recently suffered a broken back and as such he also provides care for his father when needed. In light of his current family responsibilities, [the applicant] is unable to secure full-time employment. However, he plans to explore the possibility of attending university in the foreseeable future to improve his employability.""
There is also a reference to the applicant's partner being pregnant. We are told that she lives with the applicant and his mother. The pre-sentence report goes on to stress that what happened was totally out of character and that the risk of re-offending was low, providing that the applicant did not mix with the wrong company. The author proposed a suspended sentence with conditions and stated that any custodial sentence, if immediate, would have ""detrimental implications for his family as he is the registered carer for his mother and also assists his incapacitated father"".
8. On behalf of the applicant Mr Winship, realistically and rightly, accepts that at first sight there can be no complaint at a custodial sentence of this order. Indeed, it might be said that at second sight that would also seem to be so. He accepts that this application for leave to appeal may seem unusual. He rightly acknowledges that the public is fed up with this kind of prevalent and frightening public disorder. This was a group attack on people acting in a public spirited way in protesting at loutish behaviour, one of whom suffered serious injuries in consequence of being attacked, all this at night in a public place. It is ironic that the applicant should have associated himself with this group attack after his own previous experience of violence inflicted upon him which caused him to leave the Bexley area.
9. Mr Winship nevertheless submits that this sentence was too long. He was reluctant, however, to attribute the words ""manifestly excessive"" to the sentence: although this court can ordinarily only interfere if the sentence is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. At the heart of Mr Winship's argument today is a plea for mercy. He submits that if mercy is shown to the applicant, as he says is justified, then the sentence either should have been, and should be, suspended, or at all events it should be reduced from the six month term imposed by the judge. Mr Winship founds himself on the applicant's guilty plea, his positive good character and his age, all of which were acknowledged by the judge. But Mr Winship's main focus of emphasis was to concentrate on the applicant's mother's position and also the position of his father and of his pregnant girlfriend. The applicant is the registered full-time carer of his mother and there is a degree of dependence on the part of the mother and it would not be right that she should be separated from him as her carer for any time longer than is necessary.
10. It appears to us that the mother is not fully dependent on the applicant in the sense of 24 hours a day. Indeed it is to be noted that for a period of time the applicant was able to attend an electrical engineering course in Bexley, he had employment with Harrods for a period of time, and he has ambitions of attending university in the foreseeable future. All that indicates that there will be a means by which his mother's needs can be catered for. Although it may be that for the applicant to serve a custodial sentence will have a detrimental impact upon her, there is nothing to indicate that the consequences of his having to serve a custodial sentence will be devastating so far as she is concerned. Indeed we are told today that the applicant's pregnant girlfriend is apparently still living with the mother. So far as the father is concerned, no doubt he has much appreciated and benefited from the applicant's support, but that is little basis for departing from what otherwise is a wholly justified sentence.
11. Mr Winship concentrates wholly and solely on the applicant's personal circumstances and the mitigation available to him, including the impact on his family. However, the court must have regard not only to the situation of the applicant, but also to the offence offence. This was a very nasty offence. It cannot possibly be said that the sentence imposed by the judge was in any way excessive or failed to have due regard to all the mitigation available.
12. Accordingly, in those circumstances this application is refused.

Mr Justice Pitchers
:
Introduction.
1.
On 8 May last, we heard the appeal of this appellant against his sentence of two years imposed for four offences of indecent assault. We dismissed the appeal against the custodial term but adjourned consideration of the legality of the order that his licence be extended under
s86
of the
Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000
(PCC(S)A) so that counsel might be instructed as an advocate to the Court to assist the court on what is a matter of law of some importance. As will become clear in this judgment, we have been greatly assisted by Mr Tim Owen QC who was so instructed.
2.
For the full details of the facts of the case and our reasons for dismissing that part of the appeal, reference should be made to the judgment delivered on 8 May
[2003] EWCA Crim 1518
. For the purposes of this part of the judgment, the only relevant facts are these:
i.
The appellant pleaded guilty to four offences of indecent assault for which he was sentenced to a total of two years, which custodial term we upheld;
ii.
the charges represented a course of conduct of indecency against his two stepdaughters who at the time of the offences were 10 and 8;
iii.
The offences were committed between 1976 and 1979 and 1976 and 1982 respectively.
3.
The judge wished to include as part of his order an extension to the licence period to which the appellant would normally have been subject. The power to do so under s85 of PCC(S)A was not available because that section expressly applies only to offences were committed after 30 September 1998. The judge therefore purported to exercise his power under
s86
which applies to sexual offences committed before 30 September 1998. The question raised in this part of the appeal is whether there was power to extend the licence in the way that the judge did or whether that was unlawful as being a retrospective penalty and as such in breach of Art 7 (1) of the ECHR.
4.
Before dealing with the major point in the appeal, we should dispose of a subsidiary argument advanced by Mr. Goodman in his written submissions but not elaborated orally. He argues that, if the order was lawful, it should not have been made on the facts of this case. We disagree. The necessary criteria, which we set out in full below, were satisfied and it was not wrong in principle for the judge to make the order that he did.
The statutory framework
5.
PCC(S)A 1986: Sexual offences committed before 30th September 1998
(1) Where, in the case of a long-term or short-term prisoner -
(a) the whole or any part of his sentence was imposed for a sexual offence committed before 30th September 1998, and
(b) the court by which he was sentenced for that offence, having had regard to the matters mentioned in
section 32(6)
(a) and (b) of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
, ordered that this section should apply,
sections 33(3)
and 37(1) of
that Act
shall each have effect as if for the reference to three-quarters of his sentence there were substituted a reference to the whole of that sentence.
(2) Expressions used in this section shall be construed as if they were contained in Part II of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
.
(3) The reference in subsection (1) above to
section 33(3)
of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
is to
section 33(3)
as it has effect without the amendment made by
section 104(1)
of the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
(which substituted the words ""on licence"" for the word ""unconditionally"" and does not apply in relation to a prisoner whose sentence or any part of whose sentence was imposed for an offence committed before 30th September 1998).
6.
The matters mentioned in
section 32(6)
(a) and (b) are ""the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders"" and ""the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and of securing their rehabilitation"". That section was originally contained in
s44
of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
which came into force on 1 October 1992. That section was itself amended by
s 58
of the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
.
7.
The effect of the interplay of these sections is this. In an ordinary case, if the sentence is at least twelve months but less than four years (""a short term prisoner""), the prisoner is released after one half of his sentence and remains on licence until he would have served three quarters of his sentence had he not been released. If his sentence is four years or more (""a long term prisoner""), he is eligible for release on parole after one half of his sentence, he must be released after two-thirds and also remains on licence until three quarters of his sentence would have been served. If, in a sexual case, the judge passing sentence has made an order under PCC(S)A
s86
, the licence continues not until the prisoner would (but for his release) have served three-quarters of his sentence but until the end of the total sentence.
8.
The consequences of any breach of licence were set out in
section 38
of
the 1991 Act
:
38. —(1)A short-term prisoner—
(a) who is released on licence under this Part; and
(b) who fails to comply with such conditions as may for the time being be specified in the licence, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.
(2) The magistrates' court by which a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) above may, whether or not it passes any other sentence on him—
(a) suspend the licence for a period not exceeding six months; and
(b) order him to be recalled to prison for the period during which the licence is so suspended.
(3) On the suspension of the licence of any person under this section, he shall be liable to be detained in pursuance of his sentence and, if at large, shall be deemed to be unlawfully at large.
This section applies to any prisoner who is serving a sentence for an offence committed before 30 September 1998 although it has been repealed for all other purposes.
9.
The potential consequences for a defendant in respect of whom an order under
s86
of
the 2000 Act
is made are thus that he may, if in breach of his licence, be fined or recalled to prison for up to six months.
10.
It is those potential consequences that lead counsel for the appellant in the present case to argue that a sentence passed under
s 86
for an offence committed before 1 October 1992 (the commencement date of
the 1991 Act
) violates Article 7(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights as being a heavier retrospective penalty. Consistent with the Court’s duty under
section 3
of the
Human Rights Act 1998
to give effect to legislation in a way that is compatible with Convention rights so far as is possible, counsel argues that this provision should be interpreted as not applying to cases involving offences committed before 1 October 1992. This argument is not advanced in relation to sentences for offences committed after 1 October 1992 but before 30 September 1998.
11.
Had the appellant been sentenced for these offences at the time he committed them, his release would have been governed by the
Criminal Justice Act 1967
. Under
section 60
of
that Act
, a prisoner serving a two year sentence was eligible to apply for parole after twelve months of his sentence and would have remained on licence until the two thirds point.
The test under the Convention
12.
Article 7 (1) reads as follows:
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.
13.
Certain matters are not in dispute between the parties. First, ""penalty"" is an autonomous concept under the Convention. Secondly, the relevant leading case in the European Court of Human Rights is
Welch v UK
(1995) 20 EHRR 247
. The criteria for determining whether an order is a penalty, distilled from that case, were set out by this court in
R v Field and Young
[2002] EWCA Crim 2913
.
i. The starting point is whether the measure is imposed following a criminal conviction (see paragraphs 28 and 29 of the judgment of the ECtHR);
ii. The nature and purpose of the measure are also relevant (see paragraphs 28 and 30);
iii. Its characterisation under national law is relevant (see paragraphs 28 and 31);
iv. The procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure are relevant (see paragraph 28);
v. Its severity is relevant (see paragraphs 28 and 32);
vi. The court will look at the substance, rather than the form, in determining whether the measure forms part of a ""regime of punishment"" (see paragraphs 27, 33 and 34)
Relevant case law.
14.
The courts have been called upon to determine whether a measure is a penalty and to apply the
Welch
criteria in a number of recent cases. For present purposes they can be divided into two broad categories: those where the court had to consider a measure which stood on its own and those where the court was considering early release from a custodial sentence. The first group of cases is helpful in showing the approach of the Courts to this issue but it is the second group which is most closely analogous to the present case.
Cases involving stand-alone measures
15.
The case of
Welch
itself concerned a confiscation order made under the
Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986
, the operative provisions of which came into force on 12 January 1987. The drug offences triggering the order were committed in 1986. The ECtHR held that the measure was a penalty. The sweeping nature of the statutory assumptions, the fact that confiscation was not limited to the actual enrichment, the discretion in the judge to have regard to the culpability of the accused and the possibility of imprisonment in default were elements which taken together provided a strong indication of a regime of punishment.
16.
In
R v Taylor
[1996] 2 Cr App R 64
this court held that a confiscation order which involved confiscating the proceeds of drug trafficking before the coming into effect of the relevant Act did not violate Art 7 because the conviction which triggered the confiscation proceedings related to conduct after the coming into effect of
the Act
so the Defendant must be presumed to have known the consequences of his offending when he committed the offence. This distinction from
Welch
was also made in the subsequent decision in the European Commission of Human Rights (
Taylor v UK [1998] EHRLR 90)
17.
In
Ibbotson v UK
[1999] Crim LR 153, an application to the ECtHR in respect of the registration requirement under the
Sex Offenders Act 1997
was refused on the grounds that the measure was preventive rather than punitive and hence did not violate Art 7.
The same view for the same reason was taken by this court of a disqualification order under
section 28
of the
Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000
insofar as it operated retrospectively:
Field and Young
[2002] EWCA Crim 2913
Cases concerning early release
.
18.
Understandably, Mr Goodman for the appellant puts the decision of this court in
J.T.
[2003] EWCA Crim 1011
at the forefront of his argument. That case is the only one in which the precise issue of orders made under
s86
of PCC(S)A in respect of offences committed before 1 October 1992 has been considered. The court said at paragraph 19 of the judgment that :
There is no doubt, in our judgment, that these provisions are punitive and are properly to be contrasted with purely preventive measures that do not invoke any principle against retrospective penalty.""
Accordingly, the court held that
s86
must be read as not applying to offences committed before 1 October 1992. It follows that, if we come to a contrary conclusion, it can only be on the basis that J.T. was decided
per incuriam
.
19.
In an admissibility decision
, Hogben v UK (Appn 11653/85)
the Commission rejected the argument that the introduction in 1983 of the tariff system by the then Home Secretary was a breach of Art 7. Although part of their reasoning can no longer be regarded as sound following the decision of the ECtHR in
Stafford v UK
(2002) 35 EHRR 1121
and of the House of Lords in
R (Anderson) v Home Secretary
[2002] 3 WLR 1800
, the following paragraph is unaffected by those decisions:
Although [the change in parole policy] may give rise to the result that his imprisonment is effectively harsher than if he had been eligible for release on parole at an earlier stage, such matters relate to the execution of the sentence as opposed to the ""penalty"" which remains that of life imprisonment. Accordingly it cannot be said that the ""penalty"" imposed is a heavier one than that imposed by the trial judge.
20.
The nature of licence provisions in determinate sentences was considered recently by Moses J in the Administrative Court in
Uttley v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWHA 950 (Admin).
The claimant was a long term prisoner whose offences had been committed before 1983. The passing of
the 1991 Act
meant that he would be eligible for release on licence at a later point in his sentence than would have been the case had he been sentenced in 1983. He argued that these provisions were contrary to Art 7. In rejecting that argument, Moses J said this:
14. It is plain that the purpose of a licence is to enable the long-term prisoner to stay out of trouble, both for his own benefit and for the benefit of the community, and so that thereby he does not lose his liberty. True it is that, if he breaches his licence, he is at risk of recall, but the licence itself is designed to avoid the risk of further offences and a return to prison. Nor in any real sense can it be said that the imposition of the licence follows conviction. The judge makes no order. The licence follows by virtue of the operation of
section 33
on release and is plainly part of the rehabilitation process.
15. I conclude that the nature and purpose of the licence are such that they dominate the factors which go to the conclusion as to whether the imposition of the licence is a penalty or not. The imposition of the licence is designed to protect the public once a prisoner is released, and assist in preventing the prisoner from committing further offences.
In the present case, the extension of the licence is imposed by the judge at the time of sentence. However, in our judgment, the analysis of the purpose and effect of licence provisions set out in that passage is correct.
21.
The case of
McFetrich v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWHA 1542 (Admin)
was decided on 30 June 2003 but the judgment was not available at the time of the oral hearing of this case. Accordingly, counsel have not had the opportunity to consider it. However, it is relevant to the present case since it deals with the impact of Art. 7 on the tariff period of a mandatory life sentence. Scott Baker LJ said this:
Article 7 is concerned with retrospectivity and the word ""penalty"" is in my view referring to the whole penalty rather than to its constituent elements. The penalty is a life sentence and the fact that some prisoners, perhaps the vast majority, are released during their lifetime does not prevent the sentence from being a life sentence. Even after release the sentence continues for the prisoner is on licence for the rest of his life and liable to recall to prison. If he is recalled to prison he will inevitably serve a greater period in custody than the original tariff.
A sentence of life imprisonment is different from a determinate sentence because it contains separate elements aimed (i) at retribution and deterrence and (ii) at the protection of the public. It is, in my judgment, however, not possible to equate the period to be served for retribution and deterrence (the tariff) with the penalty for the offence. Put slightly differently, Article 7 is not concerned with the machinery for carrying out the penalty but rather with the penalty itself.
Application of the
Welch
criteria.
22.
(i) Measure made following a criminal conviction.
Clearly the order can only be made when there is a conviction.
23.
(ii) The nature and purpose of the measure.
The statutory criteria for the making of an order are ""the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders"" and ""the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and of securing their rehabilitation"". Although these criteria are expressed in words suggesting a preventive measure and are in the context of a section dealing with the basis for release on parole, it should be noted that the words of the first are the same as one of the pre-conditions for passing a custodial sentence in violent or sexual offences (s1(2)(b)).
24.
We have set out above our view of the correct way of looking at licence provisions in the context of Art. 7 generally. Strong support for the proposition that this is the proper view of
section 86
is contained in the judgment of this court given by Lord Bingham CJ in
R v Hodgeon
[1997] 1 CAR(S) 399:
[
s44
] is a section which gives the authorities additional control over an offender in relation to whom such an order is made. It affects both the period which an offender will serve if recalled to prison after release on licence and the period for which a prisoner will be supervised after release on licence. In making such an order the primary considerations to be borne in mind are the need to protect the public from serious harm from offenders, the desirability of preventing the commission by them of further offences and the rehabilitation of offenders.
25.
(iii) Its characterisation under national law.
Although the forerunner of
section 86
was passed before the incorporation of the
Human Rights Act 1998
, there is no doubt that Parliament intended that the measure should apply to all offences committed before 30 September 1998 regardless of whether they predated the coming into force of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
. It is also true that the section was applied retrospectively after the passing of
the 1991 Act
both at first instance and in this court. That has continued since the implementation of the
Human Rights Act 1998
and, with the exception of
J.T.
to which we will return, has not been questioned in this court.
26.
(iv) The procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure.
An order under
section 86
can only be made as part of a custodial sentence. The maximum length of that sentence remains unchanged by
the 1991 Act
. It will only be implemented in the event of a breach by the released prisoner. The licence terminates at the end of the notional sentence and cannot exceed it.
27.
(v) The severity of the measure.
There is no doubt that the extended licence in itself involves a restriction of the liberty of the released prisoner even if he does not commit a breach of it. A breach may lead to a penalty of up to six months imprisonment. That, however, is not conclusive. Breaches of a number of orders held not to be penalties may similarly lead to loss of liberty or other sanction if breached.
28.
(vi) The substance, rather than the form.
It is the exercise of looking at the substance rather than the form that we have been carrying out in our review of the statutory provisions and relevant case law.
Conclusion
.
29.
In our judgment, the true analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and the way in which they have been interpreted in the domestic and European courts demonstrates that an order for an extended licence is preventive not punitive. Its operation relates to the ""execution of the sentence "" (
Hogben
) and is part of ""the machinery for carrying out the penalty"" (
McFetrich
). Adding such an order to a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed before 1 October 1991 is not to impose a heavier penalty than was available when the offence was committed and does not violate Art.7
30.
As we have already indicated, the conclusion to which we have come necessarily involves the further conclusion that
J.T
. was wrongly decided. In concluding that we may properly consider that decision as per incuriam, we have had regard to the guidance given recently by this court in
R v Simpson
[2003] EWCA Crim 1499
in relation to the modern doctrine of per incuriam in criminal cases.
31.
Lord Woolf CJ giving the judgment of a five judge court said:
34. ….. We appreciate that there may be a case for not interpreting the law contrary to a previous authority in a manner that would mean that an offender who otherwise would not have committed an offence would be held to have committed an offence. However, we do not understand why that should apply to a situation where a defendant, as here, wishes to rely upon a wrongly decided case to provide a technical defence. While justice for a defendant is extremely important, justice for the public at large is also important. So is the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system….
35. Here we prefer the approach indicated in
Bennion
on Statutory Interpretation (4th edition) at p 134 which states:
""The basis of the
per incuriam
doctrine is that a decision given in the absence of relevant information cannot be safely relied on. This applies whenever it is at least probable that if information had been known the decision would have been affected by it.""
32.
There are two significant factors in this case which fall into the category of information referred to in the quotation from
Bennion
. First, and importantly,
J.T.
was a sentence appeal where only the appellant was represented. The Court therefore did not have the benefit of the sort of submissions which have been advanced to us by Mr Owen. Secondly, the Court had cited to it only one of the cases to which we have been referred namely
Ibbotson v UK.
In particular, neither
Hogben
nor
Hodgeon
was cited and each is, in our judgment, important to the proper consideration of this issue.
33.
Mr Goodman reminds us that we are a two judge court and the court in
J.T.
was a three judge court. That is a relevant consideration: See
Simpson
at paragraph 38. However, that cannot outweigh the other factors to which we have referred. We have come to the clear view that
J.T.
should be regarded as decided
per incuriam
and not followed. Had the court in that case been provided with the information that we have had, we have no doubt they would have come to the same conclusion as we do.
34.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.","citation:

Judgment
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
1. On 22 December 2011 in the Crown Court at Stafford before His Honour Judge Maxwell and a jury the appellant was convicted of two counts of indecency with a child (counts 1 and 3), two counts of indecent assault (counts 2 and 4), and six counts of sexual activity with a child. The child in counts 1 to 7 was ""LH"". The prosecution's case was that she was a victim of sexual abuse by the appellant between June 2002 and June 2005 when she was aged 13 to 15. Counts 8 to 12 involved ""TE"", aged 15. Sexual activity took place with her between December 2004 and June 2005.
2. The defence was somewhat unusual. There was no dispute about the fact that sexual activity had taken place between the appellant and each of the two girls. His case was that it was consensual in fact and consensual in law -- in other words, neither girl was under age on the occasions when sexual activity took place.
3. There was very little dispute about the nature of the sexual activity, although in relation to the incident covered by count 7 there was some question as to where sexual intercourse had taken place or whether what had happened had not involved penetration (and therefore was not sexual intercourse).
4. Following conviction the appellant was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on counts 1 to 6 and to six years' imprisonment on counts 7 to 10, the sentences to run concurrently. The appellant was required to comply indefinitely with the provisions of Part 2 of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
(notification to the police), and he will be included in the relevant list arising under the regulations which safeguard vulnerable groups.
5. The appellant appeals against conviction by leave of the single judge.
6. There are four grounds of appeal. One relates to the evidence and three relate to the way in which the judge dealt with three matters in the summing-up.
7. The offences need no detailed recitation. Count 1 alleged that the appellant incited LH to masturbate him when she was 13; count 2 that he had kissed her, fondled her breasts, and inserted his fingers into her vagina; counts 3 to 6 alleged the same sort of activity; and count 7 that sexual intercourse had taken place when she was 15. The appellant's case was that sexual activity had occurred after LH was 16, but that he had not penetrated her; his penis had touched the outside of her vagina, but there was an interruption from someone coming upstairs and so that was the end of that.
8. Counts 8 to 10 alleged that the appellant had penetrative vaginal intercourse with TE. There was no dispute that it had taken place. The issue again was the age of TE when it took place.
9. The problem relating to the evidence concerns LH alone. She was born in June 1989. She was 22 years old at the time of the trial. There was no dispute that the appellant knew her age. When the relationship had come to an end LH told somebody about it. After receiving some counselling from a church pastor, to whom she was unable to articulate what had happened, she wrote it all down in a notebook. Her mother found the notebook and wanted to know what it was about. LH told her mother that it related to a friend, not to herself. Eventually, she confided in a friend who persuaded her to go to the police. She saw a male police officer and ""felt horrible"". A female officer saw her in July 2010. She wanted to conduct a video-interview but LH was unhappy about this and exhibited disturbed behaviour. She was referred to her general practitioner. In August 2010 she took an overdose and had to be admitted to hospital.
10. Eventually, in December 2010 and February 2011 LH telephoned a radio station. She had heard people talking about sexual abuse and she phoned in anonymously. On 24 October 2010 she signed a formal witness statement following a series of interviews in which she described the sexual activity which had taken place and her age at the relevant dates.
11. Her mother, a community officer, gave evidence that after LH had taken the overdose they tried to pick up the pieces together. She had gone to an organisation known as [a name] Tours where she had heard something about the appellant and another young female. She reported her recollection to the police woman who had finally achieved the interview with her daughter. That led the police officer to the second girl, TE.
12. TE's evidence was that she had stopped going to school when she was 15, but had returned after her 16th birthday to take some GCSE examinations. The appellant worked at the same place as she did. They talked and then got together and had sexual intercourse. The first time was on a bus in the December after her 15th birthday. It occurred again on two further occasions before she reached the age of 16, and continued after she had reached 16. The relationship went on until the appellant left his job.
13. When the appellant was interviewed by the police he declined to answer any questions. His evidence to the jury was that, following legal advice, he did not mention that the complainants were over 16. A ground of appeal arises from that fact.
14. The appellant gave evidence in his defence. We have summarised the essence of the case which he advanced before the jury. It needs no further recital.
15. The first ground of appeal relates to the evidence of LH. She told the judge and the jury that she remembered the evidence that she wanted to give but she was unable to articulate it. The judge recognised that she was highly embarrassed by the situation and had great difficulty in saying in open court what had happened between her and the appellant. In the absence of the jury he discussed the position with counsel because the case was ""not making any progress"". He pointed out to counsel for the appellant that if the matter had been dealt with by way of a video-interview there would have been no problem. It was not a video-interview; the hearsay rules applied along with the exceptions which enabled hearsay evidence to be given. Miss Heeley pointed out that this was not hearsay evidence; the witness was giving evidence and was being asked about events that were within her own knowledge. The judge enquired as to whether it was a memory-refreshing or a hearsay point. It was suggested to him that it was neither.
16. In the course of the exchange it was made clear, as the defence case statement indicated that the fact that there was sexual activity was not in dispute. The judge was satisfied that the witness knew and could remember the details of what she wanted to say, but she was unable to verbalise them because of her great difficulty and embarrassment. She had asked that her statement be made available. The statement was available. Indeed, at one stage part had been read out to her and she had adopted it. In his ruling the judge said it was ""perfectly obvious"" that unless some new step was taken the case would go on ""all afternoon and probably all of tomorrow and she will not say what is in her statement"". He reminded himself that there was no dispute as to the essential facts relating to sexual activity. The issue was age. Was LH over 16 and in a position lawfully to consent, or was she under 16 and not in a position to consent? The judge considered
section 114
of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
, which permits the use of hearsay evidence, and examined the preconditions to the admission of the statement. The preconditions are set out in
section 114(2)
. It is unnecessary to recite them here. He concluded that
section 114
did apply and that he could admit the statement as hearsay evidence.
17. The first ground of appeal is that this course was inappropriate. It is submitted that such examination of a witness, who was giving crucial evidence on which counts 1 to 7 depended, was inappropriate and should not have been permitted.
18. As the judge explained in his ruling, this statement would not be used by the witness for the purposes of refreshing her memory. Her memory did not need to be refreshed; her inability to speak needed to be overcome. The statement was read to her and she was invited to adopt its contents if she thought they were correct. She did so. The judge considered that the course permitted by the operation of
section 114
of
the 2003 Act
would have been appropriate, but that he could protect the appellant from some of the adverse effects of allowing the statement to be adduced under
section 114
, first, by ensuring that the process of reading parts of it out and inviting the witness to adopt them should apply only to matters which were not in dispute; second, that the process should not be adopted in relation to the crucial issues in the trial, that is the age when the sexual activity between the two took place, or indeed in relation to count 7, the issue of whether or not full sexual intercourse had taken place; and third, by dealing with it in this way, the witness would give her testimony orally and would then be available for the purposes of cross-examination.
19. The question, therefore, is whether, by laying down the restrictive conditions on the way in which the complainant's statement could be used, the judge, although adding to the protection normally available to a defendant, should nevertheless have disqualified the prosecution from using it for the purposes of establishing facts which were not in dispute. The question seems to us to permit of only one answer. In our judgment the judge's decision, and the way in which he arranged for this part of the evidence to be adduced before the jury, legitimately enabled the best evidence of the witness to be given, while at the same time protecting the interests of the appellant. He could have permitted leading questions to be put to the witness in any event on matters which were undisputed. It was by far better that the statement should be used for this purpose and the witness invited to adopt it or to reject it. The judge could have permitted the statement to be admitted under
section 114
of
the 2003 Act
. That would have enabled the prosecution to rely on the statement in its entirety. The procedure that he adopted protected the appellant better than either of the two alternative courses. It was a sensible adaptation of the processes of the court which caused not the slightest prejudice to the appellant or the conduct of the defence. Indeed, it reduced the risk of any unfair prejudice to him. Accordingly, that ground of appeal fails.
20. We turn to the areas of criticism of the summing-up. Three features have been drawn to our attention: the way in which the judge dealt with the issue of possible cross-contamination between the two complainants; his failure to sum up discrepancies relating to dates and events as between the evidence of the two complainants; and his direction to the jury about the possibility of drawing adverse inferences from the fact that the appellant's interview with the police was a ""no comment"" interview.
21. As to the contamination, there is no evidence of any direct communication between either of the complainants. Nor, as Miss Heeley candidly acknowledged, was any suggestion of cross-contamination put to either. The judge directed the jury that they might use the evidence adversely to the appellant if they looked at the similarities between the two cases, the character of the two girls who both ""enjoyed his attention"" and the fact that they both thought that they were having a love affair with him. That was a coincidence. The judge said:
""Can it be a coincidence that you have got two apparently independent allegations of similarity being levelled? Of course, members of the jury, this will only arise if the two sets of allegations are truly independent of each other. If there is any possibility of there being any sort of discussion between the two and they have put their heads together, there has been contamination between the two allegations, then it could not possibly be relevant ....""
In other words, if there is any possibility of contamination or cross-talk, or one of the complainants putting ideas into the head of the other, then the jury were to ignore any conclusions that they might draw between the apparent similarities between the two cases. The judge said that there was no evidence to suggest contamination between one set of allegations and the other. Complaint is made that that direction went too far.
22. We have examined the matters relied upon by Miss Heeley in support of that suggestion. There was indeed no evidence to suggest contamination as between the two allegations. What the judge said in his summing-up about it was entirely accurate.
23. It is next asserted that the judge failed to remind the jury of the discrepancies in relation to time. The crucial point in the case was the age of the two complainants when the different forms of sexual activity on which the charges are based took place. There was a good deal of evidence about that. It was examined in some detail. In his summing-up the judge repeatedly reminded the jury of the essential issue: the account given by the appellant that each girl was over age; and the account give by each girl that she was not over age. He reminded the jury of the fact that there were text messages and pictures on the phone and that ""we ended up in a pretty fair muddle"" as to when a number of things related to when these matters actually happened. He could not see how any of that evidence could help the determination whether the sexual activity happened when the complainant was 15 or 16. The criticism is that there should have been a more detailed analysis of the evidence (dates and times) relating to events such as birthdays, the taking of exams and so on.
24. This was a matter for the judge. The summing-up had clearly identified the issues which arose for decision by the jury. The account given by the appellant was narrated in careful detail. There was, in our judgment, no further need for the judge to deal with each and every timing or date. That ground of criticism fails.
25. The final matter concerns the direction as to adverse inferences. In his summing-up, having dealt with the contamination issue, the judge turned to the legal significance of the ""no comment"" interview. The agreed facts before the jury showed the words of the caution:
""You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.""
The judge pointed out that in his interview the appellant had not said what he had said in his evidence to the jury: ""The main allegations are true, but she was 16."" That, said the judge, was a very simple thing to say. He then addressed the issue of how the jury should approach the problem of the absence of any such comment in contrast to the evidence which was given before the jury. The judge's directions were entirely appropriate until he came to the explanation given by the appellant, which is that he did not mention that the girls were 16 because his solicitor had told him not to. The judge said:
""All the solicitor can do is to give him advice, and let us not leave common sense behind. Any solicitor is going to advise him, 'If you have got a defence, it will be a risky business not to present it now'.""
That led Miss Heeley -- and we quite understand why she did -- to stand up and question the judge's direction. The jury left court and the judge heard submissions in their absence. The judge explained to Miss Heeley what he proposed to say and when the jury returned he assured them that he and counsel were in agreement on the law. He directed them as follows:
""The law is this, that you will only draw a conclusion from the 'no comment' interviews that is adverse to the [appellant] if he could reasonably have been expected to mention the facts of his defence at the time when he was being questioned. He had the advice of his solicitor. Members of the jury, common sense will tell us that if the solicitor was competent he would have advised of the risk of going 'no comment'. The risks are obvious. That is built into the words of the caution. Members of the jury, if the solicitor nevertheless advised that he should go 'no comment' and he [the appellant] acts on that advice, then you cannot say he would reasonably have been expected to mention something, but the [appellant], although he said to you, 'I did what my solicitor told me to do', did agree that it was his decision and not the solicitor's decision. He actually said that in his evidence to you. Members of the jury, if it is genuine that he was acting on legal advice or it may be genuine, then you would not be drawing any adverse conclusion against him, but if you come to the conclusion that he has latched on to the solicitor's advice as a convenient shield to avoid answering questions, then the solicitor's advice would not constitute a reasonable ground for not answering questions.""
The judge then proceeded to give some further directions to supplement and complete what he had to say on that issue.
26. The complaint is that the jury would have been left with a false impression and there might have been a danger that too much weight might have been placed on what the judge said the sensible solicitor might have advised.
27. Although we do not think that the fairness of the trial was in any way impugned by this observation, it would have been better had the judge avoided any comment on what the solicitor might have advised, or might have been expected to advise the appellant. Even if it was not entirely speculative, comments like these might have served to undermine the inviolable principle of lawyer-client confidentiality. For a moment let us speculate on the possibility that the solicitor might not have been sensible and might not have given the advice which the judge thought any sensible solicitor would have given. The appellant may have felt obliged to call the solicitor to give evidence, and forced to waive confidentiality because of something said by the judge. There could then have been all sorts of complications. It would have been better had that observation not been made. However, we have reflected on the fact that it was made and the circumstances in which it was made. The appellant accepted in clear terms in his evidence that the decision which was made was his decision and not that of his solicitor. In those circumstances this ground of appeal, too, fails.
28. Accordingly, for the reasons given, this appeal must be dismissed.

LADY JUSTICE RAFFERTY:
I shall ask Mr Justice Martin Spencer to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER:
1.
On 19
th
February 2019, in the Crown Court at Exeter before His Honour Judge Evans, the applicant was convicted of stalking involving serious alarm or distress, contrary to
section 4
A(1)(b) of the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997
(count 1) and acting in breach of a restraining order, contrary to
section 5(5)
of the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997
(counts 2, 4 and 5). On 22
nd
March 2019, he was sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment.
2.
The applicant now renews his application for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against conviction, following refusal by the single judge.
3.
The facts are set out in the Criminal Appeal Office Summary and need not be repeated.
4.
Six matters have been raised by the applicant as potential grounds of appeal:
1.
The judge erred in allowing in bad character evidence in relation to the applicant's previous convictions;
2.
The judge erred in summing up the evidence to the jury as he did, not highlighting the weak nature of the prosecution case;
3.
The judge erred in allowing the prosecution to rely on extraneous material during their closing speech;
4.
The judge should have dismissed the case at the end of the prosecution case because there was no evidence upon which a jury properly directed could convict;
5.
The judge allowed the prosecution to rely on evidence of the applicant's internet history and searches, which was not relevant to the allegations; and
6.
Disclosure was requested in the Defence Statement, which was provided late or not at all.
5.
In refusing leave to appeal, the single judge said:
""You advance no arguable grounds of appeal. You criticise counsel who represented you and have waived privilege. The more I read into your trial, the more it becomes apparent that you were represented professionally and skilfully. The evidence against you was overwhelming and your conviction entirely safe. You can have no complaint about the bad character evidence, which was properly admitted. The judge's direction to the jury concerning the character evidence was exemplary. You say that the judge should not have permitted evidence to be given of your internet history and searches. This is nonsense. This was highly probative evidence. Your complaint about disclosure does not bear proper examination. The summing-up was accurate and to the point and you were properly warned about the consequences of not giving evidence. There was a minor error in the bad character schedule, but the overall nature of the offending was highly relevant and the safety of your conviction is not affected.""
6.
We wholly agree with the single judge's reasons. It is unnecessary for us to elaborate on them.
7.
In correspondence with the court, the applicant has raised a further matter. He seeks to rely on the paperwork submitted by the complainant in civil proceedings by way of a medical report and claim form which, he says, contradicts the account which she gave during the trial. This appears to relate, for example, to the account given by the complainant about the way the applicant's harassment had affected her ability to go out and play bridge or attend yoga.
8.
In our view, there is nothing in this which could potentially affect the safety of the conviction. This new point is equally unmeritorious. The renewed application is accordingly refused.
9.
In refusing leave to appeal the singe judge stated:
""You should beware of a loss of time order.""
Furthermore, he initialled the part of the form indicating that, in the event that the application was renewed before the full court and was unsuccessful, the court will certainly consider a loss of time order.
10.
The Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division observed in
R v Gray and Others
[2014] EWCA Crim 2372
that:
""The only means the court has of discouraging unmeritorious applications which waste precious time and resources is by using the powers given to us by Parliament in the Criminal Appeal Act
1968 and the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985
.""
11.
Section 29
of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
provides:
"" (1) The time during which an appellant is in custody pending the determination of his appeal shall, subject to any direction which the Court of Appeal may give to the contrary, be reckoned as part of the term of any sentence to which he is for the time being subject.""
12.
Duly warned, the applicant has, nevertheless, persisted with this renewed application. Because we consider that this application for leave to appeal is wholly without merit, and for the reasons stated in
Gray
, namely the waste of precious time and resources entailed by this application, we make a loss of time order. We order that 28 days of the applicant's time in custody pending his renewed application shall not count towards his sentence. __________________________________

Judgment
Lord Justice Leveson :
1.
On 1 December 2008, in the Crown Court at Bristol, this appellant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wilful misconduct in public office. On 24 February, after a trial lasting 3 weeks, he was unanimously convicted before His Honour Judge Darwell-Smith and a jury of a further similar offence and, on 25 February, unanimously convicted of concealing criminal property. On 22 March 2010, he was sentenced respectively to terms of 12 months imprisonment, 2 years imprisonment concurrent and 2 years imprisonment consecutive, making four years in all. By limited leave of the full court, he now appeals against his conviction for conspiracy to commit wilful misconduct and seeks to renew his application for leave to appeal the conviction for concealing criminal property. On the basis that there are on-going proceedings, the full court made an order under
s. 11
of the
Contempt of Court Act 1981
prohibiting publication of the name of the appellant and his co-conspirator (to whom we shall refer as M); we also provide anonymity to others mentioned in the case.
2.
The relevant facts can be shortly summarised. The appellant, a retired police officer, was working as a civilian employee in the Investigative Support Unit (“ISU”), which assisted frontline police officers in the investigation of criminal offences. A significant amount of the work was computer based. Over a period of time covert evidence, obtained from the appellant’s office computer and audio recordings from his ISU office, revealed that the appellant had passed confidential police information to two friends, namely, a private investigator (which led to the count of conspiracy to which he pleaded guilty) and a member of the criminal fraternity, M, whom the appellant had known for 30 years.
3.
Relevant to the challenged conviction, during 2007, M was provided both with general updates of police activity as well as information on specific cases. Thus, on 28 July, the appellant made computer searches on M, who at the time was in Thailand. Telephone records revealed contact between the two the day before and two days after the search. The searches revealed intelligence that suggested that M was suspected of cannabis dealing. On 20 September the appellant told M about a number of search warrants being executed in parts of South Wales. On 11 October, at M’s request, the appellant had a search made of the Police National Computer (“PNC”) about a vehicle of interest to M and M was informed of the results. On 3 December the appellant and M provided each other with information about a local criminal called S. On 23 December M and his girlfriend, who had both been staying with the appellant, left for Thailand via Heathrow. At M’s request the appellant searched the PNC. The search revealed nothing that might lead to M being stopped at Heathrow. In the event he was stopped but allowed to continue to Thailand after money (£17,100) in his possession was confiscated.
4.
On 22 January 2008, the appellant was arrested. A subsequent search of his home address revealed a cool box in the attic. In it were a number of plastic bags containing a total of £200,170 in sterling bank notes: this represented the concealed property. On forensic analysis one of the money bands around some of the bank notes revealed M’s fingerprint. A second fingerprint, found on one of the bank notes, belonged to another individual subsequently charged with drug offences. A later search at the appellant’s office revealed, in his desk drawer, a faxed copy of a letter from M’s solicitor to HMRC seeking the return of the £17,100. The letter had been faxed by the appellant.
5.
The system in relation to the management of informants, established by the evidence, can also be summarised. In short, the introduction of a new scheme pursuant to the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
required those who handled what are known as covert human intelligence sources (with the acronym ‘CHIS’) to be specifically authorised to do so. Furthermore, such persons also had to be authorised to act as such and could only be tasked to provide information by an authorised handler. Finally, providing an informant with police information was, in any event, in breach of basic source handling rules and was never permitted under any circumstances.
6.
Against that background, the prosecution case was that the appellant had never been approved or acted as a specialist informant handler although he had received the relevant training in relation to covert human intelligence sources and so was aware of the rules. His job with the ISU had nothing to do with handling informants or receiving intelligence. Similarly, at all material times, M was not an authorised police informant: for some six years until May 2004, M had been authorised as an intelligence source but his authority was then revoked, with the result that he could not lawfully be tasked to provide information even by a registered handler. Nevertheless, there was an agreement between the appellant and his very good friend, M, the effect of which was that the appellant, whilst acting as a public officer, accessed intelligence databases held by the South Wales Police and deliberately passed on confidential information to M. His actions, which he knew to be wrong, fell far below the standard expected of him as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in him.
7.
As for the property, the appellant had allowed a large quantity of money belonging to M to be stored in his attic. Evidence from the covert office recordings revealed conversations about “something” the appellant was keeping for M. This could only refer to the money which constituted in whole or part, M’s benefit from criminal conduct which the appellant knew or at least suspected constituted such a benefit.
8.
Turning to the defence case, the appellant gave evidence and explained that his actions had to be seen in the context of his long standing cultivation of M as an informant; his association with M went back to the 1980s. M had provided intelligence, sometimes valuable, over the years. On that basis, information which the appellant did not believe was confidential had been given to M in the hope of receiving information back. He accepted that on occasion he had acted foolishly and inappropriately in his dealings but he knew that M was not a drug dealer; he was an ‘Arthur Daly’ character who bought and sold. The appellant admitted that M had given him £10,000 in cash which he had returned but he had no knowledge of the money in the cool box.
9.
A number of witnesses were called to give evidence on behalf of the appellant including a chartered accountant who did not challenge the forensic work undertaken by the prosecution but said that it was not possible to say whether the sum of £200,170 in unexplained cash was legitimate or not. A serving police officer said that the appellant, who was conscientious and honest, had handled M for 11 years until 2005 and some of the intelligence consisting of drug related and general crime information was good. A retired police officer stated that there was a strong association between the appellant and M, who was an invaluable source of information. The appellant, whom he admired, was someone who knew how far to take matters.
10.
The issue in relation to which the appellant proceeds with the leave of the full court concerns the ingredients of the offence of wilful misconduct. At the trial, an issue was raised whether it would be appropriate for the judge to leave the defence of reasonable excuse to the jury. Mr Peter Rouch Q.C., for the applicant, contended that absence of justification or reasonable excuse was an essential ingredient of the offence; the Crown submitted that there was no basis upon which the jury could find that there was a justification for any of the disclosures or a reasonable excuse for them. The judge dealt with the matter in a short ruling which we quote in full:
“Count 1 is a conspiracy to commit wilful misconduct in a public place and there are, effectively, three ingredients. First, that he was acting as a public officer and, quite clearly, he was even though he was not a member of the police force at the time. Secondly, he has to wilfully or deliberately misconduct himself in his duties; that means simply not by accident or mistake or inadvertence. Thirdly, that he has to do so to such a degree that it amounts to an abuse of the public’s trust in the holder of that office and it seems to me that it is the members of the jury who decide whether he abused the public trust to that extent.
The fourth matter is that he did so without reasonable excuse or justification. The submission is made that there was no reasonable excuse or justification that the jury need to consider in this case because he was, according to the prosecution case – if they accept it – giving information as someone who was not dealing with informants, he was giving information in a sense like a member of the public, although he was a public officer, to another member of the public who was not an informant, who was not authorised to be an informant and he was giving that information, and if the jury are satisfied that he was giving that information, then it is submitted that there cannot be a reasonable excuse or justification in respect of that.
Of course, this offence is not the substantive offence; it is a conspiracy and it does contain a number of instances of misconduct which are not all the same but, being a conspiracy, the instances of misconduct of which the jury has heard are simply instances, or evidence of the agreement itself. So the question for me is: is it right, proper and possible in this case for the defendant to say, in a case where he says “I gave information to [M] in the hope of getting better information back again” that, for whatever reason, that is a reasonable excuse or justification?
I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution are right. That is not a reasonable excuse or justification. There is no instance upon which someone who is not a handler of information to someone who is not an informant himself. If that information is being passed and the jury are satisfied so that they are sure about that, then there is no reasonable excuse for that behaviour and I do not propose to put that defence to the jury.”
11.
True to his ruling, having directed the jury of each of the three ingredients which he accepted (including a direction that it was for the jury “to decide whether the deliberate leaking of confidential information which he knows he should not be leaking, falls far below the standard to be expected of the defendant as to amount to an abuse of the public trust in him”), the judge went on:
“There is a defence that he did so without reasonable excuse or justification. Well, the defendant’s personal initiative to encourage [M] to give him intelligence by favouring him with confidential police information could never amount to a reasonable excuse or justification in this case for three reasons. First, the defendant was not a ‘chis’ handler. Secondly [M] could not be lawfully tasked to provide it because he was not authorised to operate as a ‘chis’ himself. Thirdly, ‘chis’ rules never permit the passing of police information to anyone in any circumstances. So you can therefore disregard any reasonable excuse or justification applying in this particular case.”
12.
Mr Rouch argues that it was common ground before the court that the leading authority in relation to misconduct in public office was the decision in
Attorney General’s Reference No. 3 of 2003
[2004] EWCA Crim 868
,
[2005] QB 73
and that this authority makes it clear that it is an essential ingredient of the offence that it is committed without justification or lawful excuse. While confirming the “great variety of circumstances” in which the offence may be charged, it is certainly correct that this court analysed the history of the offence and that the head-note summarised the position (at page 73) in terms that:
“The elements of the offence of misconduct in a public officer were that a public officer was acting as such, that he wilfully neglected to perform his duty and/or wilfully misconducted himself in a way which amounted to an abuse of the public’s trust in the office holder, without reasonable excuse or justification; that whether the misconduct was of a sufficiently serious nature would depend on the responsibilities of the office holder, the importance of the public objects which they served, the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities and the seriousness of the consequences which might follow from the misconduct; that to establish the mens rea of the offence it had to be proved that the office holder was aware of the jury to act or was subjectively reckless as to the existence of the duty; that the test of recklessness applied both to the question whether in particular circumstances a duty arose at all and to the conduct of the defendant if it did arise; and that the subjective test applied both to reckless indifference to the legality of the act or omission and in relation to the consequences of the act or omission.
13.
As to the issue of reasonable excuse or justification, Pill LJ (giving the judgment of the court) said only (at para. 60):
“The failure to meet standards must occur without justification or excuse, a further requirement, though not one which has been the subject of detailed submissions.”
14.
Given the issues in that case (which concerned failure by police officers to ensure that an unconscious prisoner was placed into a ‘safe’ position with his airway clear and to obtain medical assistance), that short summary was entirely understandable but in order to understand its origins (and thus, whether the failure to leave the issue to the jury amounts to a material misdirection), it is necessary to delve further into an analysis of the authorities as to which we were not assisted either by Mr Rouch for the appellant or Mr Rupert Lowe for the Crown.
15.
Pill LJ analyses the authorities dated from
R v. Wyat
(1705) 1 Salk 380 and
R v. Benbridge
(1783) 3 Doug KB 327 and
R v. Borron
(1820) 3 B & Ald 432, to the more modern enunciations of this court in
R v. Llewellyn-Jones
[1968] 1 QB 429
which concerned the misuse by a county court Registrar of funds under his control and
R v. Dytham
[1979] QB 722
which related to the failure of a constable to intervene in a fight outside a club during the course of which a man was beaten and kicked to death. This serves to underline the varied circumstances in which this offence can be committed.
16.
In
Dytham
, Lord Widgery CJ dealt with the requirement of corruption or fraud and cited Stephen’s Digest of the Criminal Law (9
th
edn, 1950) in these terms:
“Every public officer commits a misdemeanour who wilfully neglects to perform any duty which he is bound either by common law or by statute to perform provided that the discharge of such duty is not attended with greater danger than a man of ordinary firmness and activity may be expected to encounter.”
17.
Lord Widgery went on to link the element of culpability to the degree that the misconduct is calculated to injure public interest. He said (at 727G):
“The neglect must be wilful and not merely inadvertent; and it must be culpable in the sense that it is without reasonable cause or justification.
In the present case it was not suggested that the appellant could not have summoned or sought assistance to help the victim or to arrest his assailants. The charge as framed left this answer open to him. Not surprisingly he did not seek to avail himself of it … The allegation made was not of mere non-feasance but of deliberate failure and wilful neglect.
This involves an element of culpability which is not restricted to corruption or dishonesty but which must be of such a degree that the misconduct impugned is calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment.”
18.
This decision was itself considered in
Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR
(2002) HKCFAR 381 by the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong. As noted (at para 44) by Pill LJ in
Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003)
Sir Anthony Mason NPJ referred to English and Australian authority and said (at p 409):
“84. In my view, the elements of the offence of misconduct in public office are: (1) a public official; (2) who in the course of or in relation to his public office; (3) wilfully and intentionally; (4) culpably misconducts himself. A public official culpably misconducts himself if he wilfully and intentionally neglects or fails to perform a duty to which he is subject by virtue of his office or employment without reasonable excuse or justification.”
19.
Sir Anthony expressly stated that the words were not disjunctive. He also added that the misconduct complained of must be serious which was to be determined “having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the office holder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities”. It is worth adding that, in agreeing with this judgment, Mr Justice Bokhary PJ expressed no doubt that the true definition of the offence was as Sir Anthony had stated which he expressed in these terms:
“Accordingly, the offence of misconduct in public office is committed when (i) a public official (ii) in the course of or in relation to his public office, (iii) wilfully and intentionally (iv) culpably misconducts himself and the misconduct is serious.”
20.
Although Pill LJ expressed difficulty in understanding the need for the conduct to be both wilful and intentional, he expressly approved of the view that the misconduct must be serious. In his summary of the constituent elements of the offence and, in particular, at para. 60, however, he did not explain that the words “without justification or reasonable excuse” only served as an expansion of the word “culpably”. In the context of acts of commission, focussing on the word ‘culpable’ rather than the words ‘without justification or reasonable excuse’, reverting to the approach of Lord Widgery, it is difficult to see how deliberate leaking of confidential information which a public official knows he should not be leaking and which falls far below the standard to be expected as to amount to an abuse of the public trust in him (which is how the judge left the offence to the jury in this case) could not be culpable.
21.
It is no part of the purpose of this judgment to seek to revisit the formulation of the offence as enunciated in
Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003)
although that might, in the future, become necessary; indeed, consideration of the offence by the Law Commission would be of value. Suffice to say, for the purposes of this case, however, that it would have been appropriate for the judge to explain that the phrase “without justification or reasonable excuse” meant no more than acting culpably or in a blameworthy fashion. Bearing in mind that if the jury were to conclude (as they did) that the standard of the appellant’s behaviour fell far below that which was to be expected as to amount to an abuse of the public trust in him, it is impossible to see how the jury would equally not have concluded that the conduct was culpable.
22.
Mr Rouch submits that the direction which the jury were given was not apposite because the appellant was not a police officer and was not bound by the rules relating to the handling of and requests for information from covert human intelligence sources and, furthermore, that the fact that M was not a covert human intelligence source was beside the point. We do not agree. The information which the appellant was imparting was information from police sources and he must have received it subject to the same scheme (itself governed by the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
) as did police officers. If anything, his position was even more constrained than that of police officers. Thus, although we conclude that the judge should have directed the jury to consider culpability, we do not accept that his failure specifically to direct that belief in the prospect of obtaining more worthwhile intelligence could constitute a reasonable excuse in the context of his direction that the appellant’s behaviour had to fall far below that which was to be expected as to amount to an abuse of the public trust in him renders the verdict unsafe.
23.
In connection with the conviction for concealing criminal property, Mr Rouch seeks to renew grounds of appeal in respect of which leave was not granted by the full court in relation to the admissibility of evidence from three witnesses which was directed to supporting the contention that links existed between M and cannabis (thereby justifying the conclusion that the property belonging to M which was in the appellant’s possession was criminal within the meaning of the legislation). This concerned the total of £200,000 found in cash in a cool box in the appellant’s attic. Mr Rouch suggests that the evidence was tenous in nature, of prejudicial effect only and not such as the appellant could address. In his ruling, the judge acknowledged that:
“they may be “very small pieces in a jigsaw puzzle but, put together, particularly when one remembers it is not just the link of that person with a criminal activity but the link of this money to criminal activities that it becomes important. And they become important pieces of evidence which when taken together are compelling. And if they are taken together they are compelling, they are of probative value, then they are admissible.”
We agree with this analysis. We also agree that the prosecution was required to prove that the money came from criminal sources and that this was an entirely appropriate way of so doing. There is no arguable ground of appeal in relation to the admission of this evidence.
24.
Finally, in his written grounds, Mr Rouch makes complaint of three errors of fact said to have been made by the judge during the course of his summing up. None appear to have been the subject of comment by counsel at the conclusion of the summing up but we have considered the points individually and collectively, bearing in mind that the jury had heard the evidence and speeches of counsel and had been directed specifically to consider the facts as they found them to be. We do not consider that this ground erects an arguable error sufficient to render the verdict on this count unsafe.
25.
In the circumstances, this appeal is dismissed.","citation:

Judgment
Tuesday 17 June 2008
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
I will ask Mr Justice Goldring to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE GOLDRING:
1. These three appellants were charged with murder. On 7 January 2008 (the day fixed for trial), at Newcastle Crown Court, Hughes and Miller pleaded guilty on re-arraignment. Sentence was adjourned until after the trial of Bonellie. On 22 January 2008 Bonellie was convicted of murder. On 29 February the appellants were sentenced by His Honour Judge Milford QC as follows. Bonellie, who is now aged 17, was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure; the period of 18 years (less 186 days spent on remand) was specified. Hughes, who is now aged 22, was sentenced to life imprisonment; the specified period was 22 years (less 186 days spent on remand). Miller, who is now aged 16, was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure; the specified period was 15 years (less the identical period on remand). The appellants now appeal against sentence by leave of the single judge.
2. The fundamental issue in this appeal is whether the judge was right to categorise the seriousness of the murder in this case as ""particularly high"" with a starting point for an offender aged 18 or over of 30 years under Schedule 21 to the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
.
3. The facts were these. On the evening of 23 August 2007 the deceased (Martin, aged 23), who had spent the previous nine years in psychiatric hospitals and suffered from a learning disability and other psychiatric conditions, was systematically attacked, tormented, humiliated and finally beaten by the appellants whom he misguidedly believed to be his friends. They had punched, head-butted, kicked and stamped on him until he died. At no point was he aggressive towards them. The Crown's case was that they carried out the attack for their own sport. Both Bonellie and Miller had trained as amateur boxers.
4. There was evidence that over the years local youths had taken advantage of Martin. The judge did not take that into account as against the appellants.
5. That evening so keen was he to be accepted by the group that even when he was being assaulted, Martin would apologise to his assailants, shake their hands and at one point went to an off-licence to buy them some alcohol.
6. At about 9.15pm on 23 August Martin was with the appellants when they started to dare each other to hit him for money. Miller hit him first sufficiently hard to knock him to the ground. He got up. After they had walked a little further, Hughes hit him and knocked him to the ground. They bet with each other who could knock him out. Miller punched him as they reached a bus stop, again knocking him over. The violence continued as they went on their way. Miller hit him while holding a can of drink in his hand. Bonellie jogged up to him and said that he was going to knock him unconscious. Hughes got in first and knocked him over. The three of them laughed at him. He got up. The group carried on. Martin was punched. He fell off a wall. He was crying, but still apologised to them. He did not want to leave the group. Hughes launched an assault by punching Martin three times so that he again fell to the ground. The violence continued and became worse. As Martin lay on the ground they all jumped and stamped on him. Eventually they propped him up against a parked car. Hughes took a couple of steps back and kicked him hard in the face. He was bleeding. They dragged his unconscious body around the back of the car. The pulled his trousers and underwear down to his ankles and walked off. By this time it was about 10.30pm.
7. Residents had witnessed part of the assault. The appellants claimed that he deserved to be kicked because he had burgled an old woman's home. The appellants later told their friends some details of the attack, but sought to distance themselves from it.
8. Martin was rushed to hospital. He was found to be deeply unconscious. There was no evidence found of any brain function. He was pronounced dead. He had 22 recent injuries. It appears that 18 separate blows had been delivered to the head and neck.
9. The appellants subsequently surrendered to the police. Bonellie admitted that he was present, but denied violence. Hughes admitted hitting him a couple of times, but only after he had overheard Martin asking a young boy to go burgling with him. He denied any part in the violence and blamed the other two. Miller declined to comment, but a prepared statement was read out in which he admitted being present and assaulting Martin, but claimed that Martin was alive and conscious when he left.
10. The sentencing judge had before him antecedent histories and various reports on each of the appellants. Bonellie had two previous convictions for threatening behaviour in 2007. Hughes had a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2003. Miller had a previous conviction for battery in 2007. Bonellie's pre-sentence report assessed the risk of him re-offending as medium to high. He was said to be ashamed of his actions and genuinely remorseful. Hughes was described as presenting a high risk of serious harm to the public. Again it was said that he appeared to be genuinely remorseful. In Miller's case there was a psychological report. His IQ level was assessed as low (we are told 79). A pre-sentence report assessed the risk of him re-offending and causing serious harm to the public as high.
11. In passing sentence on the appellants the judge first considered whether, in fixing the minimum terms, he should enhance the sentence to deter others. As he did not do so, it is unnecessary to refer to what he said about that. Second, having referred to Martin as a gentle, caring person, the judge described the appellant's conduct. We need not repeat that. Third, the judge set out the starting points. He said:
""I now have to address myself to the starting point. Mr Hedworth QC for the Crown has submitted that the appropriate starting point under Schedule 21 is 15 years for Hughes, who is 21 years of age, and 12 years for the remaining defendants because they are under 18. I questioned whether that was right and whether by virtue of paragraph 5(1) and 5(2)(e) of the Schedule, this being a murder where the seriousness of the offence was particularly high and involving sadistic conduct and an extremely vulnerable victim, the starting point for Hughes was not 30 years. Mr Hyland QC for Hughes has sought to argue that 15 years is the starting point and an imbalance in sentence will be achieved between you and your co-defendants if I move to the higher point.
I am unpersuaded by that argument. If the nature of the offence demands the higher starting point, that is the point at which the court should start and arguments of parity are beside the point.
Having satisfied myself that the appropriate starting point for Hughes is 30 years, I stress I do not add to that starting point by reason of the aggravating features ....""
12. Having set the starting point at Hughes at 30 and that for Bonellie and Miller at 12, the judge set out the mitigating features. He found that there was no intention to kill; that the offence was not premeditated; and that Bonellie and Miller were not as heavily involved as Hughes. He referred to the reports which he had seen; that Bonellie was lightly convicted; and that Miller was of previous good character. He discounted the minimum terms of Hughes and Miller by one-sixth to reflect the pleas on the day of trial.
13. The essence of the argument before us is that the 30 year starting point should not have been chosen. As Mr Hyland QC on behalf of Hughes submitted, the 30 year minimum should be reserved for the gravest murders short of the whole life term. He submitted that this was not a murder involving sadistic conduct. He accepted in Hughes' case the aggravating features. He accepted that the judge was entitled to conclude that Hughes was the most culpable. He submitted that the mitigating features were in any event inadequately taken into account. He emphasised Hughes' plea of guilty, the lack of an intention to kill, the lack of premeditation and planning and that the appellants had come across the victim by chance. He also submitted that, although the oldest, Hughes was still young at the time.
14. The submissions on behalf of the other two appellants were posited upon the basis that the starting point in Hughes' case was too high. It followed that the minimum terms imposed on them consequentially were themselves too high. It was also submitted that there was an inadequate balance between the aggravating and the mitigating features.
15. On behalf of the Crown Mr Caulfield does not go back on the submission to the trial judge that the starting point in this case should have been 15 and not 30 years.
16. The first issue, therefore, to which we turn is: what was the right starting point for Hughes? Was this an offence the seriousness of which was particularly high within the terms of Schedule 21? There is no doubt that the behaviour of these appellants was appalling. They were rightly described in the opening note as acting like a pack of animals. They did so for amusement and to make themselves look big. Does that conduct amount to sadistic conduct for the purposes of paragraph 5(2)(e)? The current edition of the Oxford English Dictionary defines ""sadism"" in these terms:
""Enthusiasm for inflicting pain, suffering or humiliation on others.""
Sadly, it is often the case that those who attack others derive pleasure from so doing. Many a person kicking someone else on the ground derives such pleasure. A person, too, may gain pleasure from baiting a vulnerable individual, or showing off to his friends. That is not enough, in our view, to bring the case within subsection (e). That subsection contemplates a significantly greater degree of awareness of pleasure in the infliction of pain, suffering or humiliation, perverted though the pleasure we have described may be.
17. Although we can understand how the judge came to the view he did, in our judgment appalling though this behaviour was, it fell short of that sort of conduct which is contemplated as sadistic by the subsection. This was a very bad case of gratuitous gang violence directed at a vulnerable individual. In short, the starting point should not have been 30 years for Hughes; it should have been 15.
18. The aggravating features in Hughes' case are clear. We need not repeat them. They merit a significant increase on the starting point of 15 years. Balancing the aggravating and the mitigating features, we have concluded that in his case the appropriate minimum term would be one of 19 years.
19. We turn to Bonellie. He did not have the mitigation of a plea of guilty. He is younger than Hughes. He was not as involved as Hughes. He is lightly convicted. Bearing all those features in mind, and again performing the balancing exercise to which we have referred, it seems to us that the appropriate minimum term in his case would have been one of 15 years.
20. Miller was the youngest. He pleaded guilty. It seems to us that in his case the appropriate minimum term would have been one of 13 years.
21. In the result, therefore, we quash the minimum terms imposed by the judge. We substitute those terms to which we have just referred. The period spent on remand which the judge ordered to be set off against those terms will be set off against the fresh terms we have imposed. To that extent this appeal is allowed.","citation:

JUDGMENT : APPROVED BY THE COURT FOR HANDING DOWN (SUBJECT TO EDITORIAL CORRECTIONS)
Mr Justice Jack:
Introduction
1.
The appellant, John Foggon, is now 57 years old. Since 1985 he has run a successful company, first named Vaclensa Limited, which then became Vaclensa PLC. He is chairman and until March 1999 owned 55% of the shares, the balance being held within his family. The company supplied cleaning machines and had service contracts with commercial customers including breweries and hotels. In the year to 31 March 1999 its turnover was more than £4 million. The company banked with Lloyds.
2.
Between 1 June 1990 and 31 October 1998 the appellant arranged for substantial sums of money received from Vaclensa’s customers totalling £1,007,034 to be paid into a bank account in the company’s name with the Trustee Savings Bank. The existence of this account was not disclosed to Vaclensa’s auditors. The monies which went into it were not declared for tax. The appellant used the monies largely for his own private purposes.
3.
On 23 March 2001 the appellant pleaded guilty to an offence of cheating the public revenue. On 11 May 2001 he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. Confiscation proceedings were postponed and were heard before His Honour Judge Humphries on 30 August 2001. A confiscation order was then made by the judge in the sum of £1,068,441 with 6 years imprisonment in default, to be consecutive to the sentence of 2 years. The sum has been paid.
4.
The appellant appeals against the making of the confiscation order with the leave of the single judge to argue three grounds of appeal. Those are :
i)
that the applicable statutory provisions were those of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
prior to amendment by the
Proceeds of Crime Act 1995
, whereas the judge held that the amended provisions applied;
ii)
that the judge was wrong to hold that the amount of benefit was the amount of money paid into the TSB account less certain deductions, but should have held that it was the amount of tax not paid;
iii)
that in any event there should have been a credit against that benefit in the sum of £125,000 which was paid on account of VAT after the appellant faced proceedings.
Which statutory provisions applied?
5.
The judge proceeded on the basis that the case was governed by the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
as amended by the
Proceeds of Crime Act 1995
. The prosecution now accept on the basis of
R v Ahmed
, Court of Appeal, unreported, 8 February 2000 and
R v Brown
[2001] EWCA Crim 2761
, Court of Appeal, unreported, 7 December 2001, that this was wrong. Those cases were not cited to the judge. As the offence commenced before the commencement date for the amendments,
the 1988 Act
should have been applied as unamended by
the 1995 Act
. The relevant difference is that under
the 1988 Act
as unamended the judge had a discretion whether to make a confiscation order and as to its amount. Under the Act as amended he would have had a duty. The judge held that, if he was wrong and his power was discretionary, he would nonetheless make an order in the circumstances. That was plainly right and has not been challenged before us. So, subject to the possible resurrection of discretion in connection with VAT (to which we will come), this ground has gone.
What was the “benefit”?
6.
Sections 71 (1) to (7) of the 1998 Act prior to amendment provided :
“71 (1) The Crown Court … shall … have power, in addition to dealing with an offender in any other way, to make an order under this section requiring him to pay such sum as the court thinks fit.
(2) The Crown Court may make an order against an offender where –
(a) he is found guilty of any offence to which this Part of this Act applies; and
(b) it is satisfied –
(i) that he has benefited from that offence or from that offence taken together with some other offence of which he is convicted in the same proceedings, or which the court takes into consideration in determining his sentence, and which is not a drug trafficking offence; and
(ii) that his benefit is at least the minimum amount.
(4) For the purposes of this Part of this Act a person benefits from an offence if he obtains property as a result of or in connection with its commission and his benefit is the value of the property so obtained.
(5) Where a person derives a pecuniary advantage as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence he is treated for the purposes of this Part of this Act as if he had obtained as a result of or in connection with the commission of the offence a sum of money equal to the value of the pecuniary advantage.
(6) The sum which an order made by a court under this section requires an offender to pay must be at least the minimum amount, but must not exceed –
(a) the benefit in respect of which it is made; or
(b) the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be realised at the time the order is made,
which ever is the less.
(7) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the minimum amount is £10,000 or such other amount as the Secretary of State may specify by order made by Statutory Instrument.”
7.
By section 102 (1), “property” includes money. Section 102 (5) provides :
“References in this part of this Part of this Act to property obtained, or to a pecuniary advantage derived, in connection with the commission of an offence include a reference to property obtained or to a pecuniary advantage derived, both in that connection and in some other connection.”
8.
The amount of the confiscation order, £1,068,441, was the total of the sums paid into the account (£1,007,0034) less £87,674 (which was agreed to be from sources unconnected with the offence), giving £919,360, which was then adjusted to take account of changes in the value of money as required by section 74 (5) of the Act. It was agreed before the judge to be the correct figure if the prosecution approach to the value of the benefit received by the appellant was right.
9.
The prosecution approach was as follows. Section 71 (1) (a) required the court to be satisfied that the appellant had benefited from the offence. Section 71 (4) which relates to where property is received, then applied to determine whether he had benefited and the amount of the benefit. The appellant had received property as a result of the commission of the offence, or in connection with its commission, namely the monies in the TSB account amounting to £919,360. For the appellant has been able to treat these as his own, and has done so.
10.
The argument before Judge Humphries on behalf of the appellant was that this was not a case falling within section 71 (4) of the Act but was covered by section 71 (5) which relates to where an offender derives a pecuniary advantage as a result of or in the connection with the commission of the offence. The pecuniary advantage was submitted to be the amount of the unpaid corporation tax due on the profits paid into the TSB account namely £450,398. It was submitted that the case was indistinguishable from that in
Attorney General v Moran
[2001] EWCA Crim 1770
, 27 July 2001, unreported.
11.
The judge held that the prosecution’s approach was correct and that the case was covered by section 71 (4). Early in his judgment he stated :
“He diverted the money to a concealed account for his own purposes and failed to declare it to the Inland Revenue.” (page 33H)
Later he stated :
“Money transferred to the account was property obtained in connection with the commission of the offence ….” (Pages 34H, 35A)
12.
The submissions before us have taken the same form. The essential issue is whether the money in the account was, with the exception of the £87,674 referred to above, money obtained by the appellant as a result or in connection with the offence, within the meaning of section 71 (4).
13.
The Particulars of Offence given in the indictment read :
“
PARTICULARS OF OFFENCE
JOHN JAMES FOGGON and JENNIFER AILEEN SPENCER between the 1
st
day of June 1990 and 31
st
day of October 1998 with intent to defraud and to the prejudice of Her Majesty the Queen and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue cheated Her Majesty the Queen and the Commissioners of Inland Revenue of public revenue namely income tax and corporation tax and interest thereon by
(i)
diverting company income of Vaclensa Limited to their own use.
(ii)
diverting company income of Vaclensa Plc to their own use.
(iii)
failing to disclose to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the existence of untaxed profits of Vaclensa Limited.
(iv)
failing to disclose to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the existence of untaxed profits of Vaclensa Plc.”
We mention that the prosecution ultimately offered no evidence against Jennifer Spencer and she was acquitted.
14.
The offence was thus stated to comprise the diversion of monies coupled with the failure to disclose. If the diversion of the monies was an essential part of the offence and properly included in the particulars in the indictment, it becomes impossible to say that the monies appropriated by the appellant were not properly obtained as a result of it. No objection was ever taken to the form of the indictment : we do not suggest that it should have been.
15.
The prosecution case was as stated, that all the money in the account, with the exception noted, was property received by the appellant. The basis of this was that he had had control of the monies and the ability to use them for his own purposes as he chose. As a statement of fact, that was not challenged before the judge and was accepted by him. There is a suggestion in the papers that some part of the monies in the account were used for the proper purposes of Vaclensa. This could have permitted an argument that these monies should have been deducted as not being property obtained by the appellant. But the sum was not identified before the judge and the argument was not pressed before him. No particular sum could be identified before us: the schedule which purported to do so, emanating from the appellant’s accountants, appeared to relate to something else. In any event the sum was but a small proportion of the total, and the prosecution approach that in the circumstances the whole of the monies in the account should be treated as obtained by the appellant was right. There was no other basis on which the judge, or this court, could proceed.
16.
It was submitted on behalf of the prosecution that, even if the appellant had only appropriated, for example, half the monies in the account for his own use, and the balance had been properly used for the company’s purposes, albeit undeclared for tax, in the circumstances he should be treated as having obtained the whole for the purpose of section 71 (4). We would simply say that in such a situation is seems to us arguable that the appellant would have “obtained” only the proportion of the monies in the account which he appropriated to his own use. But that is a long way from the actual situation here.
17.
Even if the approach is taken that there were in reality two offences here, first cheating the Revenue, second stealing monies from the company, this would not assist the appellant. For the removal of the greater part of the monies from the TSB account for the appellant’s benefit would have been an essential part of an overall scheme having the combined purpose of defrauding the Revenue and benefiting him. On this approach the monies he obtained would still be monies obtained in connection with the commission of the offence of cheating the Revenue. We need say no more as to the effect of section 102 (5) than that on the basis considered in this paragraph, it could only assist the prosecution.
18.
It is therefore to be concluded that the present case falls within section 71 (4) as the judge held and that he correctly assessed the benefit.
19.
The suggestion made on behalf of the appellant that his case fell within section 71 (5) relating to pecuniary advantage, and that the advantage derived by him was the unpaid tax, namely £450,398, has insuperable difficulties. The tax was not due from the defendant. It was due from the company, Vaclensa. At the most, as a 55% shareholder it was to his financial advantage if the company avoided tax. The pecuniary benefit to him of it doing so would be a matter of calculation, and the calculation might not be straightforward. It seems to us that the tax avoided, or attempted to be avoided, will only be a pecuniary advantage obtained by the offender in two situations. One is where it is tax for which he himself is liable. That was the situation in
Moran
. The other is where any companies involved are fronts for the offender and it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil. That was the situation in
R v Dimsey & Allen
[2001] 1 Cr. App. R (S) 497. In that situation too, it becomes his tax.
20.
In
Moran
the defendant was a market trader. He traded in his own right. There was no company. There was no misappropriation of money. For 20 years he understated his income on his tax returns. He was charged with cheating and making false statements. In confiscation proceedings it was alleged that the benefit he had received was the whole of his undeclared profits - £386,584. The judge rejected that submission and made a confiscation order in the sum of £190,000 representing under payment of tax and interest. The issue was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General. In giving the judgment of the court, Mantell LJ. stated at paragraph 8 :
“8. We have little help from authority. What is plain and has been accepted before this court as it was before the Judge is that we are dealing with a pecuniary advantage. On the face of things the pecuniary advantage would seem to be represented by the underpayment of tax which resulted from the failure to fully disclose profits. On the wording of the Act the pecuniary advantage must be taken to include any interest accrued or investment returned upon that sum. Giving the words of Act their ordinary and natural meaning it is hard to see how the balance of the profits which are the product of lawful trading can be said to represent a pecuniary advantage which has resulted from or come about in connection with the commission of an offence. We reject Mr. Perry’s argument that where there has been systematic and persistent non-disclosure of profits the whole enterprise is to be regarded as fraudulent and the proceeds liable to forfeiture. It seem to us, therefore, that, authority apart, the judge was plainly right.”
21.
In
Dimsey & Allen
(which preceded
Moran
) Allen was convicted of 13 counts of cheating the public revenue in an amount of £4 million. The main point that was argued was that a failure to pay tax did not amount to a pecuniary advantage for the purpose of section 71 (4) of the Act because the tax remained payable. The court held that the deferment of payment of tax was a pecuniary advantage in the amount of the tax deferred. Laws LJ. stated at page 501 :
“Had these very grave frauds succeeded then, in crude terms, Mr. Allen would have been better off to the tune of £4 million. That represents in our judgment, the measure of his pecuniary advantage.”
22.
A second point was dealt with briefly. It was that the tax liability was not the liability of Allen but that of a number of offshore companies, and that any pecuniary advantage arising from the withholding of the tax would be their advantage and not Allen’s. Laws LJ. stated at page 502 :
“However, it is plain from the authorities cited by the Crown that the corporate veil may fall to be lifted where companies are used as a vehicle for fraud. Here the companies in question were the appellant’s alter ego: we refer to our judgment of July 7, 1999 for the full facts.”
That judgment dealt with the appeals against conviction, and contained a full statement of the facts.
23.
In conclusion on this aspect of the appeal, where a person misappropriates money from a company as an essential part of a fraud on the Inland Revenue, and is convicted of that fraud, he is liable to a confiscation order in the amount of the monies which he has misappropriated on the ground that the monies are property obtained as a result of or in connection with the fraud.
The VAT point
24.
After the Inland Revenue had discovered what the appellant had been doing, he was anxious that the outstanding tax should be repaid. In December 2000 a cheque of £250,000 drawn on Vaclensa’s account was proffered to the Inland Revenue. As the Revenue had already decided to seek a confiscation order against the defendant it was returned. The defendant was advised that, if he wished to make a payment on account of any confiscation order which might be made against him, payment could be made to the Manchester Magistrates Court. In addition to a cheque from Vaclensa being offered to the Revenue on account of corporation tax, a cheque from Vaclensa was offered to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in the sum of £125,000 on account of value added tax. This cheque was accepted. Vaclensa’s liability for VAT was thereby reduced by that sum.
25.
It was argued before us that the sum of £1,007,034 in which the confiscation order was made should be reduced to take account of this payment. The argument was put on the basis that the money in the TSB account was partly VAT money and so the appellant did not get the benefit of it. The factual answer is that he did. He appropriated the money in the account and had the benefit of it, regardless of whether it was notionally VAT money or not. Meanwhile Vaclensa remained liable for the VAT.
26.
This point was not raised before Judge Humphries. It was advanced to us on the basis that the judge should have exercised his discretion arising under section 71 (1) of the Act (prior to amendment) to exclude the VAT “element” of £125,000. We are satisfied that for the reason set out in the previous paragraph the proper exercise of the judge’s discretion would have been to take no account of the payment made by Vaclensa to the Commissioners after the discovery of the fraud.
Conclusion
27.
The appeal must be dismissed.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE STANLEY BURNTON: This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on Gavin Lee Ellis, a young man aged 28, who, on 5 August 2008 at Guildford Crown Court, pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated burglary and agreed that one other offence of burglary was to be taken into consideration, and who, on 5 September 2008, was sentenced by His Honour Judge Critchlow to seven years' imprisonment.
2.
The facts of the very nasty aggravated burglary involved in the index offence are these. The complainants were Jason Boyce and his girlfriend, Leanne Oliver, aged 21 and 20 respectively. Boyce lived with his mother and his eight year old brother in South Godstone.
3.
Just before 8.00 am on 20 May 2007 Boyce was at home in bed with Miss Oliver. His eight year old brother was asleep in another bedroom. There was a third empty bedroom of his mother. Boyce and Miss Oliver were awoken by two men who came into the bedroom. Miss Oliver woke to see a man, who is described in the summary as male 1, wearing a balaclava and holding what she described as a meat cleaver. The second man, who according to the Crown was the applicant and which he admits, did not have his face covered. He stood over Boyce holding a long thin carving knife. Both men had been told there might be money in the premises. They demanded £30,000. Boyce said he did not have that kind of money. Male 1 said, ""Show me where the safe is."" Boyce had a small safe next to his bed which contained items of sentimental value. He was told to open it and did so.
4.
Male 1 then left the room, leaving the applicant with Boyce and Miss Oliver, who at that stage remained in the bed. Male 1 went into Boyce's mother's bedroom and took from there a tin which contained a small amount of cash and jewellery. He brought it back to the bedroom where the others were. He said something to the effect of that was not what they had come for, implying that there was more for them to take away. Male 1 left the room again and returned to the room with a safe that he found in the airing cupboard. The safe belonged to Boyce's sister who did not live at the address. He threw the safe on the bed and demanded that Boyce open it. Boyce stated it did not belong to him and he did not know the code. He offered to telephone his sister to find out the code but male 1 told him in a threatening way not to be so stupid and that he would not be telephoning anyone.
5.
Male 1 left the room again. The applicant then demanded that Boyce remove the wires to his PlayStation 3 games console so he could take. Boyce got out of bed and did as he was told. The applicant emptied a sports bag and told Boyce to put the PlayStation and some games into the bag which he did.
6.
Male 1 returned. At some stage there were threats made to harm Boyce's eight year old brother. They were not made directly to the boy who was still in his bedroom but to Boyce who was told that if he did not co-operate and give them the money they were after they would effectively take it out on the younger brother. Male 1 (that is to say, not the applicant) then said, ""No, no, don't do that. I have children of my own. We're not going to touch the young boy.""
7.
Throughout what took place the eight year old boy was in his own bedroom, appearing be to asleep. He had no knowledge of what was going on, so, although there was a threat, it was not in any way implemented. However, the threat having been made, Boyce said that there was a safe in the loft. Boyce was told to retrieve the safe. The applicant and male 1 then left with the safes, which were assumed to be small portable, mobile telephones that belonged to everyone in the house money and jewellery. It was thought that about £2,000 in cash was stolen but there was nothing from the complainants to indicate the amount of money or the loss.
8.
The matter was reported to the police. The applicant's fingerprint was recovered and on 3 June 2008 he was arrested. On interview he made no comment. In an identification parade he was identified by both Boyce and Miss Oliver. Male 1, the other offender, was never identified or arrested.
9.
In her victim impact statement Miss Oliver said she had permanent feelings of fear, especially if she was in the dark. She was not happy staying at the Boyce's house anymore and as a result the relationship had suffered. In his statement Boyce said he could not sleep and he had been very worried and scared since.
10.
There was a basis of plea in this case to this effect.
11.
1. At the material time the applicant had a serious addiction to crack cocaine. He was in debt to his dealer to the extent of £500 to £600. His dealers was pressurising him to repay the debt. He could not.
12.
2. In order to pay the debt [he] was instructed to commit the aggravated burglary with the other man (someone he did not know). He believed there would be adverse consequences for him or his family if he did not do as he was instructed. He was promised an additional £500 if successful.
13.
3. He and the other man were told that Jason Boyce's brother-in-law was involved in drug dealing and that there would be about £29,000 on the premises. He had never met Jason Boyce before.
14.
4. The only person that he expected to be in the premises was Jason Boyce. He would never have harmed anyone in those premises, least of all the eight year old boy (he has a seven year old daughter of his own). They shut the eight year old's door during the incident. He never woke up.
15.
5. He received £500 from the proceeds and his debt was cleared.
16.
The offence taken into consideration was a domestic burglary in Warlingham, Surrey. The applicant admitted having stolen a laptop computer, DVD player, a mobile telephone, items of jewellery and cash. The value of the property taken was not known but clearly they included items of value. £500 damage was caused.
17.
The applicant is heavily convicted. He has 33 previous convictions. The majority are for driving offences and failure to surrender but they also include four other offences of burglary (all residential), one of attempted burglary (not residential) and one of handling stolen goods.
18.
There was a pre-sentence report, in the course of which the applicant stated, as he had by the basis of plea, that the offence resulted from the duress of a drug dealer to whom he owed money. He admitted offending to fund his drug use.
19.
The probation officer stated that his offending history indicated deficits with problem solving and consequential thinking and concluded there was a medium risk of reoffending. There was a risk of harm. He had not previously carried weapons or directly approached victims, but this was a step up from his previous offences.
20.
There is a good prison report. There is a letter from the applicant's partner, supporting his story that he was coerced into committing the offence, and a supporting letter from her mother. We have taken those into account.
21.
The authorities on violent domestic burglary or robbery in the home were recently reviewed by this court, differently constituted, in
Attorney General's Reference Nos 38, 39 and 40 of 2007 (Crummock, Stell and Campbell)
. The judgment of the court in that case was referred to, and implicitly approved, by this court in the recent case of
Saw
. In that case there was a violent robbery in a home, violence was actually caused and injuries suffered by the victims. Indeed one of them died as a result of the offence.
22.
Having reviewed the previous authorities on the level of sentencing in cases such as the present, the court said in paragraph 30:
""30. We take the view that, following a trial for these robberies, a person with no previous conviction should be sentenced to a period of imprisonment in the region of seven to seven and a half years. Such a sentence would be consistent with our suggested sentence for a category 2 robbery with the additional aggravating feature of the robbery taking place in the victim's home.
31. In our view, the appropriate sentence for all three offenders after a trial, given their individual aggravating circumstances, was in the region of eight to eight and a half years. The sentences of two years six months and two years nine months were unduly lenient. Taking into account the early pleas and reducing the sentences by a small amount to reflect the aspect of double jeopardy, we substitute sentences of five years' imprisonment concurrent for offenders 1 and 3 and five years' detention in a young offenders institution concurrent for offender 2.""
23.
We do not consider it helpful to measure in minute detail the comparative gravity of the offence in that case and that in the present case. The victims in the present case were understandably terrified by the weapons brandished by the applicant and the second man and whatever was said by them at the time the victims must have thought there was an obvious risk they would be used otherwise there would be no reason for the burglars to have them. There is the further aggravating factor of the threat to injury a young boy. We accept that the applicant was an unwilling offender on this occasion, but that, in our judgment, does not justify a substantial decrease in a sentence otherwise appropriate.
24.
He initially denied the offence but is entitled to credit for his plea of guilty. The other mitigating factor is the fact that in the end no violence was inflicted on anyone; but that may well be a reflection of the weapons used and the fear of the victims that they might be used.
25.
Having said all of that, we nonetheless consider that the sentence of seven years was on the authority that we have referred to somewhat excessive. We consider that the appropriate sentence in this case is one of six years' imprisonment. In those circumstances, we grant leave to appeal. Unless within seven days the applicant notifies the court that he wishes the matter to be considered again, the sentence of seven years will be quashed and replaced with a sentence of six years' imprisonment. The applicant will be aware that any further representations are unlikely to be considered to be meritorious or effective. To the extent therefore the appeal, as it now is, succeeds.
26.
MR HALLOWES: In those circumstances may I ask for a representation order?
27.
LORD JUSTICE STANLEY BURNTON: Certainly.
28.
MR HALLOWES: Grateful.
29.

MR JUSTICE JACOBS:
1.
This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge.
2.
On 22 December 2022 in the Crown Court at Winchester the applicant (then aged 40) was convicted of manslaughter.  On 6 January 2023 the applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of burglary from a dwelling.  On that day he was sentenced by Her Honour Judge Miller KC, who had presided over the trial of the manslaughter offence.  The applicant was sentenced to 12 years for manslaughter and a consecutive term of 2 years for the burglary.  In view of the applicant's prior criminal record, the burglary offence attracted a minimum custodial sentence of 3 years before a possible maximum 20 per cent reduction for plea, but the judge considered that it would be unjust to impose the minimum term for reasons of totality and accordingly her sentence was 2 years.  The original application for leave to appeal would, if granted, require a short 3-day extension of time.
3.
The facts concerning the offences were as follows.  On 23 October 2021 the applicant unlawfully killed Clare Gafan (aged 40).  A few days earlier, around 16 or 17 October, the applicant committed a dwelling burglary in Southampton.  He had driven to the area from his home in Derby, having recently lost his employment and relapsed into cocaine use.  The applicant entered a flat through the rear window while the occupier was out.  He carried out an untidy search, and stole cash, two watches and a pair of diamond stud earrings with a total value of between £700-£800.  His DNA was found at point of entry, and cell site evidence showed that he had been in the area.  In his police interview, the applicant denied the offences but admitted being in Southampton to purchase drugs.
4.
Having spent around a week in Southampton the applicant travelled to Bournemouth in his Audi motor vehicle.  On Friday 22 October he stole £30 worth of Class A drugs from Clough Dent, a drug user from whom he had purchased drugs a couple of days earlier.  On Saturday 23 October the applicant returned to the same area and was seen by a friend of Dent's.  This friend told the group he was with what had happened the night before.  The applicant was seen to drive down a dead-end road.  The group, which comprised the deceased and a number of others, collected Dent, who happened to live on that same road.  They then went to find the applicant.  As they approached, the applicant accelerated away in his Audi, heading towards the group and striking the deceased.  The expert evidence at trial was that the car reached around 19 mph and that it took 1.8 seconds to cover the 8 metres between where the car was stationary and where the deceased was hit.  She was thrown over the roof of the car and landed heavily on her head.  She immediately lost consciousness and never regained it.  She died two days later in hospital from un-survivable brain injuries.  There was an extensive fracture to the base of her skull, bleeding in the brainstem and underneath the membranes encasing the brain.  Her shaken brain became soft and crumbly after being starved of blood and oxygen.
5.
Following the collision, the applicant drove out of Bournemouth, but the damage to his vehicle's bonnet meant that he had to stop on the outskirts of town.  The applicant contacted a car recovery company and said that he had hit an animal.  In fact the applicant was able to drive back to the Midlands, where he was arrested later that evening.
6.
In her careful sentencing remarks the judge described the incident and the defendant's background.  He had many previous convictions, including for dishonesty, low level violence and dangerous driving, but these were all committed between 1995 and 2013, and the references provided on his behalf showed that he had subsequently held down a responsible and well-paid job.  The judge accepted the prosecution's argument that this case of unlawful act manslaughter was culpability B under the applicable guideline, because death was caused in the course of an unlawful act which carried a high degree of death of grievous bodily harm which was or ought to have been obvious to the applicant.  She rejected the defence argument that this case fell into culpability C.  She said that there was clearly an obvious risk of very serious harm by accelerating at the group.  She described it as a case where the applicant was using his car as a weapon against the approaching group.  She agreed that his primary design was to get away rather than to cause injury, but she said that the applicant did not care how he did it or whether anyone was injured. Under the guideline the starting point for culpability B manslaughter is 12 years with a range of 8-16.  She identified as aggravating features the applicant's previous convictions, albeit that he had never committed a similar offence and that there had been a lull in his offending, and his actions after the event in leaving the scene and trying to get away.  She accepted that there were two important mitigating factors - remorse and lack of premeditation; although she thought that the latter was a stronger point.  The judge considered that the aggravating and mitigating features in effect balanced each other out and therefore that the appropriate sentence was at the starting point under the guideline, namely 12 years.  For the burglary she imposed the consecutive sentence of 2 years.
7.
In his written grounds of appeal Mr Pyne, who appeared on behalf of the applicant at the trial and sentence, submitted that the judge had erred in concluding that this was a category B culpability case.  The lack of premeditation was a factor, he submitted, which reduced culpability.  The driving was intended to cause fear rather than to cause harm; alternatively if it was category B, it was a less serious example of such an offence and therefore the judge's sentence was too high.  It was also submitted that the judge had paid insufficient regard to mitigating factors, namely the applicant's remorse, his suicide attempt whilst awaiting trial, and the gap of 8 years between these offences and the applicant's previous offending.  The decision to make the burglary sentence consecutive also made the total sentence manifestly excessive.
8.
In his oral submissions this morning, to which I will return in due course, Mr Pyne has to some extent refined his submission or at least focused on a particular aspect of it.  He has nevertheless maintained the points raised in his original grounds of appeal, and I start by addressing those by reference to what the single judge said.  The single judge addressed the various points carefully and comprehensively when he refused leave to appeal.  We agree fully with what he said and will quote the following:
""You complain that the Judge wrongly categorised your case within the Sentencing Council Guideline on Unlawful Act Manslaughter as one falling into category B. I disagree. You drove in the direction of a number of people, accelerating hard as you did so. This act created an obvious risk of killing someone or of causing someone the most serious injury. That entitled the Judge to categorise the case as she did. That is so despite your lack of premeditation and that your intention was to frighten people so that they jumped out of the way.
You also aver that, if this was a category B case, the Judge should have sentenced you to a term within the bottom part of the range and not, as she did, to the term set as the starting point for an offence in that category. In conjunction with that you assert that the Judge should have afforded more weight to your mitigation. The Judge heard the trial and was best placed to weigh up the competing factors at play in your case. The Judge accepted that you were to an extent remorseful but could not give great weight to that factor when you did not plead guilty and thus did not accept proper responsibility for what you had done. It is right, as set out in your grounds of appeal, that you did not have recent previous convictions but you had a number of serious convictions in the past which should rightly have been treated as aggravating your offending on this occasion. The Judge considered this aspect of the case with care and decided that the mitigating and aggravating features of the case balanced out one another. It is not arguable that she was not entitled to reach that conclusion.
Finally, you complain about the consecutive sentence of 2 years for burglary which was imposed on you at the same sentencing hearing. A consecutive sentence was not wrong in principle.  This was a different type of offence committed on a different occasion. As to length - you were a 'three-strike' burglar and thus could have expected a sentence of at least three years. The Judge reduced the term imposed upon you with totality in mind. Some Judges might have reduced it still further but the approach taken by the Judge did not result in an overall sentence which is arguably manifestly excessive.""
9.
In his submissions to us this morning, Mr Pyne has advanced essentially the same primary argument that failed before the single judge and he has focused on features of the offending which, he submitted, should on a fair assessment of culpability either take it into category C or at least should be factored into the analysis of where in category B the case sits.  The point on which he focuses is that there was an element of self-defence, albeit not amounting to a defence, and this was an attempt to get away from people.  The applicant's sole intention was to get away.  The judge did refer to both aspects in her sentencing remarks and, as Mr Pyne acknowledged, these may simply be different aspects of the same coin.
10.
We recognise that the sentencing guidelines for manslaughter do require different indications of culpability to be taken into account and that a fair balance needs to be struck.  However, in the present case it is accepted by Mr Pyne that a category B factor was present.  In our view this was unquestionably the dominant or overwhelming factor when it came to assessing the defendant's culpability in the present case and we do not consider it arguable that the judge's decision to impose a 12-year sentence after looking at mitigation and aggravating factors can be criticised as manifestly excessive.  Ultimately therefore, and notwithstanding the concise and focused submission made by Mr Pyne this morning, we remain of the same view as that expressed by the single judge and indeed the trial judge.  Accordingly, we refuse the renewed application for leave to appeal on the basis that it is not arguable that the judge's sentence was manifestly excessive.  In view of that decision we also refuse the application to extend time.

MR M HAGGAR
appeared on behalf of the Appellant.
_________
J U D G M E N T
MRS JUSTICE FARBEY:
1.
The appellant appeals against sentence by limited leave of the single judge.  He renews before us the grounds on which the single judge refused leave.
2.
On 25 July 2023, having pleaded guilty before Warrington Magistrates’ Court, the appellant was committed for sentence, pursuant to section 14 of the Sentencing Act 2020, for five offences relating to the supply of controlled drugs.
3.
On 12 September 2023, in the Crown Court at Chester before HHJ Berkson, he was sentenced as follows.  For one offence of supplying a Class B drug, namely ketamine, 8 months’ detention in a Young Offender Institution (“YOI”); for one offence of possessing a controlled drug of Class A with intent to supply, namely MDMA, 3 years in a YOI; for one offence of possessing a controlled drug of Class A with intent to supply, namely cocaine, 2 years in a YOI; for one offence of possessing a controlled drug of Class B with intent to supply, namely ketamine, 8 months in a YOI; and for one offence of supplying a controlled drug of Class A, namely MDMA, 3 years in a YOI.  These were concurrent sentences so that the total sentence pronounced by the judge was 3 years’ detention.
4.
The appellant was 20 years old at the time of his offending.  He was 21 years old at the date of conviction and sentence.  It will readily be seen that, as the appellant was aged 21 at the date of conviction, the judge made a slip in sentencing him to detention in a YOI rather than to a term of imprisonment.  The Crown Court record should be amended to correct that slip which is otherwise immaterial.
5.
We turn to the facts.  On 27 August 2022, at around 5.00 pm, the appellant was searched by a police officer while trying to enter the Creamfields Music Festival in Cheshire.  During that search, the police seized a three-day non-camping ticket to the festival, an iPhone and some drugs.  The drugs were subsequently analysed and found to be: 18 MDMA tablets, with a value of £180; a further 29 MDMA tablets, with a value of £290; 0.87 grams of cocaine, with a value (at the festival) of between £80 and £100; and 2.3 grams of ketamine in five resealable plastic bags, with a value of £100.
6.
The appellant was arrested.  In interview, he provided a prepared statement in which he stated that the drugs were for his own personal use.  He denied that he would have sold the drugs to anyone and stated: “I do not supply drugs”.  His mobile phone was analysed and messages indicative of an intention to supply drugs at the festival were found.  He had no previous convictions.
7.
The judge had the benefit of a pre-sentence report and a detailed community impact statement from a police officer with knowledge of Creamfields, which is an annual dance music festival.   In 2022, when the appellant’s offending took place, the festival ran from Thursday 25 August to Sunday 28 August.  The community impact statement makes clear that the festival is considered a high risk for drug consumption.  Police data suggests that the price of controlled drugs is higher at the festival than on the streets, to compensate for the risk of smuggling controlled drugs past the security arrangements and because of the closed market conditions.  Tragically, at the 2022 festival, a young woman died from the consumption of drugs.  When she fell ill, she was in possession of MDMA and cocaine.
8.
The prosecution case (which the judge sensibly clarified with prosecuting counsel and which the appellant accepted on a “full-facts” basis) was that the two offences of supplying drugs related to 25 August.  The evidence of supply on that date came from messages on the appellant’s phone.  The three offences of possession with intent to supply related to the drugs seized by the police when the appellant was searched on 27 August.  The offences were therefore committed on two different days.  As the judge noted, the appellant went into the festival to supply drugs and came out to replenish his stock with a view to re-entering to supply some more.
9.
In his sentencing remarks, the judge generously accepted that the appellant had sold the drugs to a group of 30 people who were his friends and who had gone together to the festival.  The judge applied the relevant sentencing guideline.  He concluded that the offences involved category 3 harm as they had involved selling directly to users.  In relation to culpability, he accepted the prosecution submission that the appellant had a significant role.  For present purposes, we focus on the more serious, Class A offences.  The starting point in relation to those offences was 4 years 6 months’ custody.  The category range was 3 years 6 months’ to 7 years’ custody.
10.
By way of aggravating factors, the judge took into consideration the appellant’s determined efforts to smuggle the drugs into the festival despite the warning signs that any drugs should be put in bespoke on-site bins.  It was an aggravating factor that the supply of drugs took place at a festival.  The appellant had been involved with more than one type of drug.
11.
By way of mitigating factors, the judge took into consideration the appellant’s age, his lack of previous convictions and his positive good character, including the high regard in which he was held by his employer.  Balancing these various factors, the judge concluded that the overall sentence after a trial would have been 4½ years’ imprisonment, which was reduced to 3 years after full credit for the appellant’s early guilty pleas.  He then pronounced the individual sentences for each offence, as we have already mentioned.
12.
The single judge granted leave on the ground that the judge had erred in concluding that the appellant had a significant role.  In support of this ground, Mr Haggar emphasises that the judge accepted that the drug dealing was exclusively to friends.  The quantities of drugs seized were not indicative of the sort of significant financial advantage that characterises a significant role.  The valuation of the drugs was low.  They were worth hundreds and not thousands of pounds.  Mr Haggar submits that, in these circumstances, the appellant should have been categorised as having a lesser role.  In sentencing him on the basis of a significant role, the judge had adopted an excessive starting point.
13.
Renewing the grounds of appeal on which leave was refused, Mr Haggar submits that the judge did not sufficiently reduce the sentence to reflect the appellant’s significant mitigation which outweighed the aggravating factors of the offending.  He emphasises that the appellant had no previous convictions and was of good character.  He was aged only 20 at the time of the offences.  He had demonstrated remorse, as detailed in the pre-sentence report.  He was at the time of the offences a drug user, owing to difficulties in his personal life but he has stopped taking drugs in light of lessons learned from his offending.
14.
Mr Haggar submits that the delay of around a year between the offending and the commencement of a prosecution amounted to undue delay.  He reminds us that this Court has held that sentencing judges should bear in mind the effect of custodial sentences in the context of a high prison population (
R v Ali
[2023] EWCA Crim 232).  He submits that it is further mitigation that the appellant is still being held under the very restrictive conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic in prisons (see
R v Manning
[2020] EWCA Crim 592; [2020] 2 Cr App R(S) 46).  Mr Haggar is instructed that the appellant is permitted to leave his cell for only 2 hours each day.
15.
We are asked to consider reducing the sentence to the level that it may be suspended.
16.
We are prepared to accept that the judge was wrong to treat the appellant as having a significant role under the guideline.  Despite some evidence of advance planning in the phone messages, there is no clear evidence of the sort of awareness of, or role in, the supply of drugs that would fall into the guideline criteria for a significant role.  On the evidence before the judge, the appellant had no expectation of more than limited financial or other advantage.  His offending was consistent with only a limited role and the judge should have sentenced him on that basis.  It follows that the starting point was 3 years for the Class A offences.
17.
We accept that the appellant had strong mitigation.  Prior to custody, he was working full time and undertaking college work, which was to his credit.  Custody interrupted his good progress towards qualifying as an electrician.  The pre-sentence report concluded that he had genuine remorse and that he had made efforts to put drugs behind him.  However, as the sentencing remarks make plain, the judge had this mitigation in mind.
18.
The three-year starting point applies to a single offence.  In this case, the judge was sentencing the appellant for three Class A offences, as well as for two Class B offences.  The appellant could expect an upward adjustment from the starting point to reflect the number of offences and the seriousness of his offending overall.
19.
As the judge observed, the appellant supplied or intended to supply two different Class A drugs.  He made determined efforts to sell drugs to a group of (on his own admission) 30 individuals.  Nor can his offending be regarded as a single course of conduct: the appellant sought to evade the festival’s very considerable security regime on two different days.  As the community impact statement vividly demonstrates, there is a need to deter people from exploiting a closed and susceptible group whose guard may be down as they enjoy themselves.  The context of drug supply at a festival was a further, serious aggravating factor.  All these factors warranted a further significant upward adjustment from the starting point.
20.
In our judgment, notwithstanding the appellant’s mitigation, the seriousness of the appellant’s offences warranted an overall sentence, before discount for pleas, at the top of the category range which is, as we have said, 4½ years.  That is what the judge concluded.  The question for this Court on an appeal is whether the sentence was manifestly excessive.  Irrespective of the route by which the judge reached his conclusion, the sentence of 4½ years, reduced to 3 years for pleas, is not manifestly excessive.  It follows that no question of a suspended sentence can arise.  We refuse leave to appeal on the renewed grounds, which are not arguable, and we dismiss the appeal.  It remains for us to express our gratitude to Mr Haggar for his helpful submissions.

1.
MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE
: The provisions of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 apply to protect the victim of these offences. Accordingly, no matter relating to her shall during her lifetime be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public identify her as the victim these offences. This prohibition will continue unless and until waived or lifted pursuant to the Act.
2.
On 4 November 2016 in the Crown Court at Woolwich, this appellant was convicted at the conclusion of a trial before Her Honour Judge Downing and a jury of two offences of rape of a child under 13 years of age, contrary to section 5(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The offences had been committed in 2010, when the complainant was 10 years old. She lived with her aunt and uncle on a housing estate. The appellant lived on the same estate. He befriended the complainant by talking to her as she walked to and from the local shops. After a short period of casual acquaintance, in the course of which it seems the complainant had become emotionally attached to the appellant, he took her to a quiet location on the estate and persuaded her to give him oral sex. This happened more than once (the complainants evidence was to the effect that there had been 3 such occasions in all), and included ejaculation on the complainants face. Within a short time, the appellant introduced other youths to the complainant. They too wanted oral sex from her. It seems that the offending stopped at a time of increased police presence in the area, and the complainant later moved away from the estate.
The appellant was arrested on the 15 July 2015. He denied all the allegations, and denied that he was responsible for Facebook exchanges with the complainant in which he had referred to the oral sex.
3.
On 16 December 2016, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to concurrent terms of 7 years and 9 months' imprisonment on each of the two counts and made the appropriate ancillary orders. The appellant now appeals against his total sentence by leave of the single judge. He has had the advantage of representation by trial counsel, Mr Hasslacher, for whose written and oral submissions the court is very grateful.
4.
A victim personal statement which was made available to the judge for the purposes of the sentencing hearing set out in clear terms the effect of these offences on the complainant and the consequences of the offences for her relationship with members of her family. Without going into the details of personal matters, the complainant was subsequently taken into care. She was left with a feeling that she had been abandoned at a difficult time. As a result of her experiencing these offences, she indicated that she had found it difficult to trust anyone. That had affected her relationships with others. She had been in a state of mental turmoil which had affected her exam results. She had found it understandably very difficult to report matters to the police and, having done so, she had had a most anxious wait for some 18 months or more before the matter was finally resolved at trial. She summarised the effect of the offences in these stark terms, saying that they had ""destroyed my life and my family"".
5.
The appellant was born on 12 September 1993 and so is now 23 years old. At the time of the offences he was aged 16, approaching his 17th birthday. He had no criminal record at that time. Subsequent to these offences, and starting in 2014, he has made a number of appearances before the courts for offences involving drugs, culminating in a 6-month custodial sentence in 2016. He has no other convictions for any sexual offences.
6.
In a pre-sentence report, the author assisted the court to the extent which was possible given that the appellant was still denying his guilt and maintaining his innocence. The author of the report did not assess him as a dangerous offender as that term is defined for sentencing purposes. The learned judge did not make any finding of dangerousness.
7.
At the sentencing hearing, submissions were made by Mr Hasslacher as to the correct application of the Sentencing Council's definitive guideline on sentencing for sexual offences. Counsel argued that the appropriate categorisation of these offences under the guidelines was category 3B. The learned judge disagreed. She concluded that it was a case of category 2 harm for two reasons: firstly, because the complainant was particularly vulnerable due to her personal circumstances; secondly, because the judge treated the offence as being a sustained incident. The learned judge then concluded that the case was one of category A culpability, again for two reasons: first, a significant degree of planning was involved; secondly, she found that grooming behaviour had been used against the complainant.
8.
For a category 2A offence in the case of an adult offender the guideline indicates a starting point of 13 years' custody and a range of 11 to 17 years' custody. For a category 3B offence by an adult offender the starting point is 8 years' custody and the range from 6 to 11 years. Thus there is, as Mr Hasslacher emphasises, a very significant difference in the guideline starting point as between the two categories, although the respective sentencing ranges do overlap to a limited degree.
9.
The judge took into account as a serious aggravating factor the evidence which showed that through the appellant the complainant had been introduced to other young men who had also taken advantage or tried to take advantage of her. She concluded that in all the circumstances the appropriate sentence for an adult offender after a trial would be 12 years' imprisonment. Having regard to the appellant's young age at the material time, she reduced that to 8 years. She made a further reduction of 3 months because the appellant had been subject to a period of detention. Thus she arrived at the total sentence of 7 years 9 months' imprisonment.
10.
Before this court, Mr Hasslacher challenges the learned judge's application of the sentencing guidelines. He submits that the total sentence was manifestly excessive. We will address briefly the criticisms which he makes of the judge's approach to the sentencing exercise, but in the end the question we must consider is whether the total sentence was manifestly excessive for the offending of which the appellant had been found guilty.
11.
As to harm, we are satisfied that the learned judge was entitled to conclude that this was a category 2 case by reason of the complainant's particular vulnerability. Mr Hasslacher argues that, whilst undoubtedly vulnerable, the complainant was not particularly vulnerable. He points out that the offence is one which can only be committed against a child aged under 13, and therefore vulnerability consequent upon youthfulness is already catered for within the guidelines. Mr Hasslacher's argument in essence is that the circumstances established by the evidence did not show any particular vulnerability going beyond that.
12.
We disagree. This is a matter of degree and one which the trial judge is in the best position to assess. The evidence showed that the complainant was only 10 years old at the time, although it is said she looked older than her chronological age; for various family reasons she was largely isolated; she knew very few people on the estate where she lived; and, it seems, unhappily, that she was not being as well protected as she should have been by the aunt with whom she was living. Evidence showed, for example, that when the appellant, who must have struck the aunt as obviously much older than the complainant, visited the complainant's flat, the aunt appears to have been complacent about treating him as her niece's boyfriend.
13.
It seems to us that in all the circumstances, including in particular his introduction of other youths to the girl, that the appellant must quickly have realised that this complainant's family and personal situation was not one in which there would be any effective constraint upon her or upon him in persuading her to allow him to engage in sexual activity.
14.
All that said, and the offence for that reason properly being categorised as category 2 harm, we must respectfully disagree with the learned judge's view that it was also a category 2 case because it was a sustained incident. It seems that the learned judge was using that term, at least in part, to reflect the fact that more than one offence had been committed. That is a distinct point. We agree with counsel that the circumstances of the individual offences did not show that any one of them was particularly protracted or prolonged. In the end, however, that is not a point which assists the appellant so far as the judge's decision that this was a category 2 offence is concerned.
15.
As to culpability, the learned judge again had to determine a question of degree, namely whether there was here a significant degree of planning. Mr Hasslacher submits there was not. He argues that, whilst there may have been some planning, it could not be categorised as significant so as to make it a case of higher culpability. In our judgment, however, the learned judge was again entitled to make the decision she did. Whether or not the complainant looked rather older than her true age, the evidence does seem to us to show very clearly that the appellant quickly realised that she was responsive to his show of interest in her and he was able to take her to a secluded place where he could persuade her to engage on more than one occasion in oral sex with him. That being our decision in that regard, we do not think any purpose is to be served by a debate about the second ground on which the judge found higher culpability, namely grooming. Suffice to say that, in the context of this case, the interpretation which the learned judge placed on that word seems to us to have added nothing to the element of planning which she was entitled to find.
16.
Thus the judge was entitled, in our view, to categorise the case as she did for the purposes of the sentencing guideline. Having done so, she determined that the appropriate sentence for an adult offender would have been 12 years' imprisonment. That was towards the bottom of the category 2A range. It was in fact within the category 2B range, and only 1 year above the category 3B range for which Mr Hasslacher contends. Bearing in mind the serious aggravating feature rightly identified by the judge of introducing other young men to the complainant, and bearing in mind that the appellant was guilty of more than one offence, we think that no possible criticism can be made of the judge's decision that 12 years would have been the appropriate sentence for an adult. Indeed, it may be said that a rather longer sentence for an adult could not have been the subject of any successful complaint.
17.
We come finally to the point which merits particularly careful consideration and to which the single judge drew attention when granting leave to appeal, namely the extent to which the appropriate sentence for an adult fell to be reduced by reason of the appellant's age at the time of the offences. It is of course always necessary in the case of a young offender to consider his maturity as well as his chronological age, and when a custodial sentence is found to be unavoidable it is usual for the length of the sentence to be significantly shorter than would be appropriate for an adult. Although the position is now different under the guideline published by the Sentencing Council which has very recently come into force, the former guidance of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which was current at the time of this appellant's sentencing, suggested that it may be appropriate, depending on maturity, to consider a starting point of between half and three-quarters of what would have been considered appropriate for an adult offender when sentencing an offender aged 15 to 17.
18.
In the context of a case such as this, in which the age of the complainant is an ingredient of the offence, it must also be borne in mind, as Mr Hasslacher rightly emphasises and as the judge rightly recognised, that a young offender is not only young, he is also comparatively close in age to his victim. In those two ways, therefore, his position is significantly different from that of an adult offender.
19.
We have considered this point with care. Our conclusion is that the learned judge made a reduction from the notional adult sentence which was in accordance with the guideline. Had there been but a single offence it might have been appropriate to make a rather greater reduction. But, as we have said, the judge here was passing concurrent sentences to reflect more than one offence of oral rape.
20.
For those reasons, we conclude that this sentence, although a difficult one for a young man to have to serve, cannot be said to have been manifestly excessive. We are grateful to Mr Hasslacher for his assistance, but we are unable to accept his submissions. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.","citation:

    Exact: We have considered this point with care. Our conclusion is that the learned judge made a reduction from the notional adult sentence which was in accordance with the guideline. Had there been but a single offence it might have been appropriate to make a rather greater reduction. But, as we have said, the judge here was passing concurrent sentences to reflect more than one offence of oral rape.

MR J AKIN-OLUGBADE
appeared on behalf of the Applicant

1.
MR JUSTICE HOLGATE:  The provisions of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 apply to this offence.  Under those provisions, where a sexual offence has been committed against a person, no matter relating to that person shall, during their lifetime, be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify that person as the victim of that offence.  This prohibition applies unless waived or lifted in accordance with section 3 of the Act.  We will refer to the victims as C1, C2, C3 and C4.
2.
On 17 October 2022 in the Crown Court at Snaresbrook, before His Honour Judge Greene, the applicant was convicted of four counts of sexual activity with a child family member (C1), contrary to section 25 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (counts 1 to 4), four counts of sexual activity with a child family member (C2) (counts 5 to 8), two assaults by penetration of a child under 13 (C3), contrary to section 6 of the 2003 Act (counts 9 and 10), two sexual assaults of a child under 13 (C3), contrary to section 7 of the 2003 Act (counts 11 and 12) and two offences of sexual activity with a child (C4), contrary to section 9 of the 2003 Act (counts 18 and 19).  He was acquitted of counts 14, 15 and 17.  Counts 13 and 16 were replaced by counts 18 and 19.
3.
On 20 February 2023 before the same judge, the applicant, then aged 48, was sentenced concurrently on counts 2 and 10 to extended determinate sentences of 14 years, comprising a custodial term of 12 years and an extended licence period of two years.  In relation to the other counts, concurrent determinate sentences of imprisonment were passed as follows: six years on counts 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12, four years on counts 3, 5, 7 and 11 and three years on counts 18 and 19.
4.
The applicant renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge.  We are grateful to Mr Akin-Olugbade for appearing
pro bono
today in order to make submissions on the applicant's behalf.
5.
The applicant married in 2003.  The couple's first daughter, C1, was born in 2005 and their second, C2, in 2006.  Between 2014 and 2021 the applicant committed a number of sexual offences against four female children, including C1 and C2.
Offences against C1
6.
Between January 2014 and October 2019 the applicant committed sexual offences against C1 when she was aged between nine and 14.  Both he and his wife used physical violence as a form of discipline and there was a period of six months when the children were placed in foster care.  The applicant was excluded from the family home before eventually returning.
7.
C1 said that the applicant used to visit and stay over from 2014 onwards.  She shared a bunk bed with her younger sister with her on the bottom bunk and her sister on the top.  The applicant would lie with C1 on the bed and touch her breasts and vagina.  She would tell him that she needed to go to the bathroom in order to get away from him.  She said this happen countless times.
8.
Counts 1 and 2 dealt with the digital penetration of C1's vagina as a single incident and multiple-incident counts respectively.  Counts 3 and 4 dealt with the touching of C1's breast as a single incident and multiple-incident counts respectively.  The applicant fell to be sentenced for digital penetration of C1 on six occasions.
Offences against C2
9.
Between March 2017 and October 2019 the applicant committed sexual offences against C2 when she was aged between 11 and 13.  By 2017 the applicant was back living in the family home.  Between 2017 and 2019 he would get into C2's bed, staying for up to an hour, and touch her vagina inside her pyjamas.  These were non-penetrative offences.  Count 5 related to a single incident and count 6 related to multiple incidents.  Counts 7 and 8, respectively single incident and multiple-incident counts, concerned the touching of C2's breasts.  The applicant was sentenced for six occasions overall.
Offences against C3
10.
C3 was born in 2008.  Her father was a long-time friend of the applicant who would go to the family home to perform odd jobs and to pray.  The applicant assaulted C3 whilst she was in the house between December 2016 and December 2020 when she was aged between eight and 11.  He digitally penetrated her vagina (a single incident in count 9 and multiple incidents in count 10).  He sexually assaulted C3 by touching her breasts (a single incident in count 11 and multiple incidents in count 12).  The assaults took place on at least six occasions.
Offences against C4
11.
C4 was the older sister of C3 and was born in 2006.  She described one incident between 2017 and 2012 when she was aged between 11 and 15.  The applicant attempted to penetrate her vagina but she was able to move and leave the room.  He was convicted instead of touching her vagina and breasts (single incident counts 18 and 19).  Her younger sister was present at the time.
12.
We have read the victim impact statements from C3, C4 and their mother.  They describe the serious harm they have suffered because of the applicant's offending.
13.
The applicant had two convictions for five offences between 2005 and 2009.  He had no relevant previous convictions and no prior experience of custody.  The author of the pre-sentence report assessed the applicant as posing a high risk of committing a further contact sexual offence.  The applicant's commission of these offences demonstrated his capacity to cause serious harm to children.  The offending took place over many years and the applicant exploited his position of trust to target four different vulnerable children.  The risk he posed to the victims and to all female children aged eight to 16 with whom he has unsupervised access is high.  The risk to other children is high given the potential to form new trust-based relationships in the future.  The applicant could be assessed by the court as being dangerous within the meaning of the 2003 Act.
14.
We have noted the two psychiatric reports on the applicant but the proposed grounds of appeal do not rely upon this material.
15.
In his sentencing remarks the judge placed counts 1, 2, 5 and 6 in Category 1A for section 25 offences because of the digital penetration, the disparity in age and the particular vulnerability of the victims.  He placed the offences in counts 3, 4, 7 and 8 in Category 2A.
16.
The judge treated the digital penetration offences under section 6 against C3 as involving culpability A because there was abuse of trust.  He assessed the harm as Category 3 because the offences in this instance were relatively short-lived and the victim was not vulnerable by reason of ""extreme youth"".  This resulted in the same level of sentence on count 9 as for count 1.  The judge treated the section 7 offences against C3 as falling within Category 2A. The judge concluded that the single incident section 9 offences against C4 fell within Category 2A.
17.
The judge explained why the applicant should be treated as dangerous, relying upon the pre-sentence and psychiatric reports and said that it was necessary in his judgment to pass an extended determinate sentence.  He passed the 14-year sentence and the determinate sentences to which we have referred.
18.
A transcript of the judge’s sentencing remarks is not available because there was a technical problem at the time.  But counsel have helpfully agreed a note of the judge's remarks and the applicant is content for his application to be dealt with on this basis.
19.
In summary, counsel submits that the sentence was manifestly excessive and wrong in principle for the following reasons:
1.
The judge did not make an appropriate reduction for the applicant's lack of relevant previous convictions.
2.
The judge double-counted or took into account unjustified aggravating features.  This complaint relates to three aspects.  First, the individual incidents were ""sustained by cumulative occurrence over a long period of time""; secondly, the basis upon which the applicant was said to have abused a position of trust was also relied upon by the judge as a feature rendering the victims vulnerable; and thirdly, the judge's relied upon vulnerability because the applicant was the father of C1 and C2, as well as disparity of age.
3.
The judge made a finding of dangerousness where one was not merited.
20.
When refusing leave to appeal, the single judge said this:
""I have considered the papers in your case and your grounds of appeal. The sentencing Judge, who, as the trial Judge, was best placed to assess both your culpability and the level of harm caused by your offending, meticulously considered and applied the relevant guidelines in this difficult sentencing exercise. He correctly identified the many aggravating features, as well as being careful not to double count for the features that were intrinsic to the offences themselves.
As to the lack of relevant previous convictions as the guidelines and case law make clear, these may be of minimal significance in cases of this type and were insignificant in your case, especially given the scale of your offending. He was entitled to increase the terms for counts 2 and 10 as he did under the totality principle and make all the sentences concurrent. Although harsh, the sentence was not arguably manifestly excessive.
The finding of dangerousness was open to the Judge on the basis of the evidence and the pre-sentence report which specifically addressed the question. The extended sentence was therefore available to the Judge, but he ordered only half the extension term available.""
21.
In addition, counsel has provided the court this morning with a speaking note which has formed the basis for his oral submissions.
22.
First, he submitted that the court below was wrong to conflate the lack of prior relevant convictions with good character or exemplary conduct and he referred to the way in which both matters are treated separately in the definitive guideline.  In our judgment, there is no merit in this complaint.  This was a case where the absence of previous relevant convictions could not have been a significant mitigating factor when sentencing the applicant for the serious series of offences involved.
23.
The second part of the submissions criticises the judge for the way in which he dealt with what are described as ""aggravating features"" giving rise to double-counting.  In fact the criticisms relate to factors which the judge addressed when deciding how to categorise the various offences on the indictment.  We will primarily to some of the arguments by way of example.  First, it is said that it was wrong for the judge to find that there had been specific targeting of a particularly vulnerable child and also abuse of trust, whether the applicant was to be viewed as the father of C1 and C2 or as a trusted adult in relation to C3 and C4.
24.
But it is plain that the judge did not rely upon abuse of trust for the section 25 offences in relation to C1 and C2.  In our judgment he was entitled to treat the offending as involving the targeting of a particularly vulnerable child.  But in any event, under the sentencing guidelines there was also a significant disparity of age, so that this was a case which qualified as culpability A in any event.  With respect to counsel, this is an example of how several of the submissions which have been advanced to the court do not accurately reflect what was actually said by the judge.  Abuse of trust was only mentioned specifically by him in relation to counts 11 and 12 and that was appropriate.
25.
Secondly, the judge did not find that any of the children were particularly vulnerable because of extreme youth. That is a harm factor which is capable of being relevant to offences under section 6 and section 7 but the judge expressly made it clear that he was not proceeding on that basis.
26.
Next, it is suggested in relation to C1 and C2, the father of whom was the applicant, that the judge should not have relied upon disparity of age and breach of trust also because they are intrinsic feature of the offence itself. But as we have observed already, the judge did not rely upon breach of trust in relation to counts 1 to 8. It is plain from the sentencing guideline for section 25 offences that categorisation does not depend upon whether somebody is, for example, a father. The offence is capable of being committed, for example by a relatively young sibling.  Therefore, the judge was perfectly entitled to treat these offences as falling within Category A because of the disparity of age between the applicant and these very young children.
27.
Next, we do not see any merit in the suggestion that the judge double-counted in relation to multiple incidents.
28.
So far as the detailed submissions which have been made to us this morning on the subject of the finding of dangerousness, it must be borne in mind that this was essentially a matter of judgment for the trial judge who heard the evidence in the case.  We cannot detect any error of principle in his sentencing remarks and we see no arguable basis for saying that he erred in any material way in the judgment at which he arrived.  In saying that we also take into account the criticisms which have been levelled at the pre-sentence report.
29.
Despite the assistance that we have received from counsel this morning in his sustained oral submissions, we agree with the single judge.  However we should say that there is one respect in which we would depart from her comments.  In our judgment this sentence was neither harsh nor severe for repeat offending as serious as this against several young children over a substantial period of time.  The applicant could have had no legitimate complaint if the overall sentence had been higher.
30.
This renewed application is entirely without merit and is refused for the reasons we have given.

1.
LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: On 12th May 2017 in the Crown Court at Manchester Crown Square, Scott Cartwright, then aged 17, pleaded guilty to offences of wounding with intent, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861; threatening another with an article with a blade or point, contrary to section 139AA of the Criminal Justice Act 1988; and assault by beating, contrary to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The first of those offences was directed against a youth of similar age, Nathan Meek. The second and third were directed against another youth, Brogan Cunningham.
2.
On 20th September 2017, having considered a detailed pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report prepared particularly with a view to the issue of dangerousness, the very experienced judge sentenced Scott Cartwright to a youth rehabilitation order for 24 months on count 1, with no separate penalty on counts 2 and 3. The youth rehabilitation order was accompanied by an intensive supervision and surveillance requirement with extended activity for 180 days, a 6 months curfew requirement and a 3 months exclusion requirement.
3.
Her Majesty's Attorney General now applies, pursuant to section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, for leave to refer that sentence to this court as unduly lenient. We grant leave.
4.
We express our gratitude to Mr Jarvis, on behalf of Her Majesty's Attorney General, and to Mr Holland, appearing today as he did in the court below for Mr Cartwright, for their written and oral submissions. We have been greatly assisted by them.
5.
The offences were committed on 19th April 2017, when Scott Cartwright was aged about 17 years and 9 months. He had no previous convictions. His one previous encounter with the criminal justice system had been a caution as a 14-year-old for an offence of attempted theft. At about 8.00 pm on 19th April he was standing outside a shop with a group of other youths. By his own account he was then intoxicated, having during the day consumed two pints of lager, a large number of alcopops and a quantity of cocaine. He was wearing a large knife or machete in a sheath which was strapped to his chest over his clothing. The court has been provided with photographs of the knife. It is a frightening looking weapon with a blade some 30 centimetres in length, bearing the inscription ""The Hunter"".
6.
Nathan Meek and Brogan Cunningham walked past the shop. According to Scott Cartwright's account (although Nathan Meek did not accept this) Meek had at some previous time sent unpleasant texts to Cartwright's younger sister. As Meek and Cunningham were passing the shop, Cartwright shouted to Meek something about ""messing with his sister"". Meek told him to ""chill out"". He repeated that suggestion when Cartwright shouted to him to accompany Cartwright over to a nearby grassed area. Cartwright then punched Meek in the eye causing him to step back. Meek shouted at him and at that point Cartwright pulled the knife from its sheath and began to swing it at Meek. Meek and Cunningham ran off. Cartwright pursued them, brandishing the knife threateningly. It was this threatening with the knife which, as we understand it, founded counts 2 and 3 in relation to Cunningham.
7.
Meek then stopped and turned to face Cartwright, who swung the knife at him about five times before running away. One of the blows struck Meek's upper left arm, causing a long, deep wound which cut down into the muscle. The wound was bleeding profusely and Meek was taken to hospital where the injury was sutured. He is left with a 7 centimetre scar and with a reduction of the strength in his left arm which is expected to be permanent. In his victim impact statement he speaks, unsurprisingly, of having also suffered a loss of confidence and of feeling anxious about going out into public places.
8.
Within a short time police officers went to a house where Cartwright was staying. He came to the front door holding the machete but dropped it when the police threatened to Taser him if it became necessary.
9.
In interview, he said that he had bought the machete that day from a shop because he wanted to add it to his collection. He said that he was on his way home to do that when he saw Meek and Cunningham. He said that he wanted to ""have a go"" at Meek about the unpleasant text messages, but not in a way which would have involved use of a knife. He said that he only produced the knife because he thought Meek and Cunningham were together advancing on him with aggressive intent. He said that he had then pursued them as they ran from the scene because he thought they were going to retrieve a weapon which they had concealed nearby. He accepted that there was no basis for these views, and suggested that the cocaine which he had taken had made him paranoid.
10.
Cartwright was remanded in custody. In all he remained in custody for almost 5 months from 21st April 2017 until he was sentenced on 20th September 2017. He entered guilty pleas at an early stage of the proceedings, in circumstances which entitled him to full credit.
11.
The pre-sentence report was a detailed and careful document. The author assessed Cartwright as being genuinely remorseful. That remorse was also evident in a letter which Cartwright himself had written to the court.
12.
The author of the report said this at paragraph 2.10:
""Scott informs me that in the three months leading up to the offence he had been associating with a different group of peers, some who were older and known offenders. It was during this period that his behaviour spiralled out of control. He was no longer living at home, instead sofa surfing at various addresses. In addition he was using cocaine and alcohol on a daily basis and had accrued substantial debts as a result of funding this habit.""
13.
The author went on to record that Scott Cartwright had described a feeling of invincibility whilst under the effects of cocaine but coupled with high levels of paranoia. He told the author of the report that on reflection he could see how his use of that drug had adversely affected both his thinking and his behaviour.
14.
The author noted that until a period of about 3 months preceding this offending Scott Cartwright had been living with his parents and had been abiding by their rules of behaviour. His attitude and general behaviour had been law abiding and pro social. Discussion with Cartwright's parents confirmed that account and confirmed the decline in his behaviour once he had begun associating with others who were plainly a bad influence upon him.
15.
The author of the pre-sentence report did not regard Cartwright as meeting the statutory definition of dangerousness. She pointed out that this offending appeared to be an isolated incident on the part of a youth who was of generally good character. She proposed that a youth rehabilitation order, with an intensive supervision and surveillance requirement would be the form of disposal which would best protect the public in the long term.
16.
The psychiatric report of Dr Mohammad Rahman endorsed that suggestion as to disposal. He gave a detailed account of Scott Cartwright's personal history, which included some early evidence of fighting at school and some dissocial behaviour and a number of examples of relationship breakdown with members of his family. Dr Rahman said that although Cartwright does not have a history of mental disorder, he did display a number of signs and symptoms which would require careful monitoring. He did not however display any clear evidence of a violent attitude.
17.
The doctor expressed the view that the risk of violence would be likely to increase if Cartwright were using psycho-active substances. He regarded him as a youth who was influenced by peer suggestions, and said that should be considered in future risk management. He said that from a mental health perspective Cartwright required early intervention in psychosis, a service focusing on young persons who are at risk of developing psychotic illness. Such services, he noted, would unfortunately not be available within any custodial setting.
18.
Prosecuting counsel submitted to the learned judge that it was relevant to consider what sentence would be appropriate for an adult offender. Having regard to the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Sentencing for Offences of Assault, counsel submitted that the offence charged in count 1 would be at the top end of the range for a category 2 offence of wounding with intent. In the case of an adult that would result in a starting point of 6 years' custody and a range of 5 to 9 years after trial.
19.
Counsel reminded the judge that count 2, if committed by one aged under 18, carries a mandatory minimum term of 4 months' custody in the form of a detention and training unless the court is of the opinion that it would be unjust to impose such a sentence. He also invited the attention of the learned judge to the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline in relation to the sentencing of young offenders.
20.
Mr Holland, for his part, urged the judge to follow the recommendations contained in the reports. He reminded the judge that there had been a lengthy remand in custody, which was relevant in a number of ways. In particular, he submitted that it would be unjust now to impose the minimum sentence on count 2.
21.
By his advocacy Mr Holland successfully overcame some initial and understandable scepticism on the part of the learned judge as to whether this really had been a chance encounter and the offences really had been unpremeditated.
22.
In his sentencing remarks the learned judge commended the reports which had been prepared. He observed that an adult offender, even after a guilty plea, could expect to go to prison for about 5 years. He referred to the need to have close regard to the individual circumstances of a young offender. He accepted that there may have been some unpleasant background as between Meek and Cartwright's sister, though that, of course, did not justify the offences.
23.
The judge made no finding of dangerousness. He identified the issue which he had to determine as being whether there should be a determinate custodial sentence or whether the appropriate disposal was the youth rehabilitation order proposed in the reports. At page 22 of the transcript of proceedings he said this:
""There are, as I have said, a number of unusual features about this case, firstly, not only the defendant's lack of a significant previous record or the guilty plea but that the defendant was plainly under the influence of drugs at the time and this was not an incident stemming from inherent mental instability but drug fuelled temporary psychosis, as Dr Rahman has so clearly and eloquently made clear. The defendant comes from a caring family who have attended today who are fully supportive of him.""
The judge then referred to plans sensibly made by Cartwright's family for him to leave the area and live with his grandmother some distance away. At page 23C the judge concluded:
""In all of these circumstances I am satisfied that the [interests] of justice are best served by this young man, who has plainly taken a seriously wrong turn in his life, to be the subject of the youth rehabilitation order, which is proposed along with intensive supervision and surveillance.""
He then spelled out the details of the order to which we have referred.
24.
For Her Majesty's Attorney-General Mr Jarvis submits that in reality this was, for an adult offender, a category 1 offence of wounding with intent. It involved not only greater harm, because it was a sustained or repeated assault, but also higher culpability because it involved use of a weapon. Mr Jarvis points out that it is only by good fortune that substantially more serious injury was not suffered by the victim.
25.
Mr Jarvis argues that in the account he gave of events Scott Cartwright had tried to minimise the seriousness of his offending. He submits that there are a number of aggravating features. First, the fact that the offence was committed at night. Secondly, the ongoing effect on Meek. Thirdly, the presence of others including in particular Cunningham. Fourthly, the fact that Cartwright was under the influence of drink and drugs. Mr Jarvis submits that in so far as the learned judge may have considered Cartwright's intoxication to be an unusual feature which mitigated the seriousness of the offence, that was an error. He submits that such mitigation as was available to Cartwright was limited to his previous good character and a degree of remorse.
26.
Overall Mr Jarvis submits that an adult offender, after trial, would have been likely to receive a sentence which could have been in excess of 10 years' imprisonment. Even giving full weight to the considerations set out in the Definitive Guideline on Sentencing Young Offenders, he submits that this offence, committed by someone approaching the age of 18, was so serious that a non-custodial sentence simply could not be justified. Having regard to Cartwright's age at the time of the offending, he submits that the sentence should have been a custodial one and the length of the custodial term should have been not less than two-thirds of the appropriate sentence for an adult offender.
27.
Mr Holland submits that the learned judge carefully and conscientiously addressed a sentencing dilemma: on the one hand this was plainly serious offending; on the other hand, it had to be viewed against the background of previous effective good character. Mr Holland argues that on the basis of the detailed reports the learned judge was correct to conclude that there was here a good prospect of rehabilitation. No doubt the judge could have imposed custody but, submits Mr Holland, he was not unduly lenient in dealing with the case as he did.
28.
Mr Holland was unfortunately not able to address the court to the effect that the learned judge's optimism had been borne out. There is before the court an updating report from the Probation Service which shows that, after a less than complete compliance with the requirements of the order, Scott Cartwright has recently fallen entirely out of contact with both his family and with those supervising him. All the indications are that the ending of contact coincides with Cartwright having learned that this appeal was to come before the court. It seems to us that, regrettable though it is that Cartwright is therefore absent from the proceedings, that is no bar to our hearing this Reference today. Both counsel accept that that is so, in particular because it seems clear that Cartwright is aware of this hearing.
29.
It also seems to us that for a young man, facing the prospect that what has been a non-custodial sentence may become a significant custodial term, an element of panic is at any rate understandable. Mr Holland is not able to point to successful performance as a factor in Cartwright's favour, but nor do we think it would be proper to regard it as a factor against Cartwright in this hearing that he has, it would seem, lost his nerve and endeavoured to avoid the proceedings.
30.
We have therefore reflected on the written and oral submissions of counsel. Looking first at the adult offending guideline for the offence charged in count 1, it does seem to us that there is force in Mr Jarvis' submission that that offence could properly be categorised as a level 1 offence. It involved, in our view, a sustained assault, not simply because of the repeated swinging of the machete but, more importantly, because the initial punch was then followed by a pursuit in order to use the machete. Even if that point may be thought arguable, on any view it was, at the very least, a most serious example of a category 2 offence. It had the aggravating features which Mr Jarvis has identified, and there was little to set in the scales by way of mitigation. Looking at the matter overall, it seems to us that in the case of a mature adult offender convicted after trial, a sentence of 10 years' custody would have been difficult to appeal. To put the matter at its lowest, we cannot think that a sentence after trial of less than 9 years' custody could have been justified. That would result of course in the case of an adult offender in a sentence of 6 years' custody after giving credit for a plea.
31.
We turn next to the important principles set out in the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline as to Sentencing Children and Young People. We begin by reading the first two paragraphs of that guidelines in the section entitled ""Sentencing Principles"":
""1.1 When sentencing children or young people (those aged under 18 at the date of the finding of guilt) a court must have regard to:
• the principal aim of the youth justice system (to prevent offending by children and young people); and
• the welfare of the child or young person.
1.2. While the seriousness of the offence will be the starting point, the approach to sentencing should be individualistic and focused on the child or young person, as opposed to offence focused. For a child or young person the sentence should focus on rehabilitation where possible. A court should
also consider the effect the sentence is likely to have on the child or young person (both positive and negative) as well as any underlying factors contributing to the offending behaviour.""
32.
Subsequent paragraphs emphasise that when sentencing a young offender, custody should always be a measure of last resort. At paragraph 1.5 the guideline emphasises the importance of bearing in mind any factors which may diminish the culpability of a young person who is not as fully developed and not as mature as an adult. That immaturity can impact on decision making and risk-taking behaviour. Paragraph 1.5 continues:
""It is important to consider the extent to which the child or young person has been acting impulsively and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences. They may not fully appreciate the effect their actions can have on other people and may not be capable of fully understanding the distress and pain they cause to the victims of their crimes. Children and young people are also likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and other external influences and changes taking place during adolescence can lead to experimentation, resulting in criminal behaviour. When considering a child or young person’s age their emotional and developmental age is of at least equal importance to their chronological age (if not greater).""
33.
Finally, with reference to the Definitive Guideline, we note that at paragraph 4.5 the court is directed to consider the extent to which the offence was planned, the level of force used and the awareness that the young person had of his actions and the possible consequences of those actions. The paragraph goes on to list other pertinent factors which we have had in mind.
34.
Emphasising that if a custodial sentence really is unavoidably necessary, it must be for the shortest period commensurate with the seriousness of the offending, the guideline states this at paragraph 6.46:
""When considering the relevant adult guideline, the court
may
feel it appropriate to apply a sentence broadly within the region of half to two thirds of the adult sentence for those aged 15 – 17 and allow a greater reduction for those aged under 15. This is only a rough guide and must not be applied mechanistically. In most cases when considering the appropriate reduction from the adult sentence
the emotional and developmental age and maturity of the child or young person is of at least equal importance as their chronological age.""
35.
The learned judge was understandably concerned to apply that guideline. We recognise that the individualised approach which must be taken with young offenders may, in many cases, properly result in a form of disposal which is significantly different from that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult offender. We understand why the learned judge was anxious to take, if he could, a course which would promote the rehabilitation of a young offender who, until a short while before these offences, had been leading a law-abiding life. These are matters requiring anxious consideration. It is abundantly clear that the learned judge gave them anxious consideration. We too have done so.
36.
With all respect to the learned judge, that anxious consideration has led us to conclude that he did fall into error in failing to give sufficient weight to the sheer seriousness of this offending. The following features of the offending are, in our judgment, important.
37.
First, Scott Cartwright was out and about in darkness or at dusk, with a fearsome weapon strapped to his chest. We are bound to say it seems most unlikely that he had just purchased it at around 8.00 pm, but even if he had, he clearly did not make his way straight home in order to keep it safe within the house.
38.
Secondly, although the learned judge was correct to conclude that there was no evidence of premeditation, there is no escape from the fact that Cartwright was very quick to draw the knife when the occasion arose. He cannot have forgotten that he was wearing it on his chest when he first chose, as he put it, to have a go at Meek and when he began the violence by punching Meek in the face. Having started the violence in that way, he then pursued both Meek and Cunningham and used the weapon in the way which we have described. Even on the most favourable interpretation, accepting that Cartwright did not initially intend to use the knife to threaten or to injure, those facts starkly illustrate how quickly circumstances can alter when knives are carried and when those who are carrying them involve themselves in some form of dispute. This, of course, is one of the reasons why the carrying of knives in public places is a matter of substantial public concern.
39.
Thirdly, having started violence with a punch, Cartwright then chose to pursue Meek and Cunningham clearly intent on attacking one or both of them with the knife. He swung the knife repeatedly. He caused a serious wound to Meek's upper arm in circumstances where a much more serious injury, or even death, could easily have been caused. Looking at the position on the upper arm of the wound, we observe that had the movement of the machete been only a few inches higher, whether because it was swung at a higher level, or because Meek happened to duck at the wrong moment, it would have missed the shoulder and would instead have struck the neck.
40.
Fourthly, Cartwright's intoxication was a significant aggravating feature. He had not only intoxicated himself with alcohol, he had also consumed a Class A controlled drug.
41.
Fifthly, we agree with the learned judge that this sadly is a case in which Cartwright had taken a seriously wrong turn in his young life. We do not underestimate the malign effect on someone of his age of peer pressure and the bad influence of others. But we must set against that the clear evidence that Cartwright had a supportive family, to whom he could turn for help. He was not suffering from mental illness and, importantly, there is nothing to suggest that he was any less mature than others of his age. Plainly the offending was out of character. But that factor has to be weighed against the seriousness of what he did.
42.
Sixthly, we note that although of course aged under 18, Cartwright was within less than 3 months of becoming in law an adult.
43.
Lastly, we agree with Mr Jarvis that only limited mitigation was available to Cartwright. In our judgment, it could carry only limited weight against such serious offending.
44.
In those circumstances, we have reached the conclusion that a non-custodial sentence simply could not be justified. Even for a young offender such as Scott Cartwright, the seriousness of the offending required a significant custodial sentence. We are very conscious that our decision will involve, in the particular circumstances of this case, not only an increase in sentence which is a very substantial one from the perspective of a young offender, but also the feature that Scott Cartwright, having been released from custody after some 5 months of pre-trial remand, will now have to return to custody. In the particular circumstances of one as young as Scott Cartwright, it seems to us that that is a matter which we can and should reflect by a reduction from the level of sentence which would otherwise be appropriate. We also take into account that since the order was made in the Crown Court, Scott Cartwright has been subject to, and to a significant extent complying with, the requirements of the non-custodial sentence imposed below.
45.
In those circumstances, we quash the youth rehabilitation order imposed in relation to count 1 as being unduly lenient. In its place we impose a sentence of detention pursuant to section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 for a term of 3 years. Having reflected on the helpful submissions of counsel, we think it best to follow the course taken by the learned judge below and impose no separate penalty on counts 2 and 3. Thus the total term which must be served will be one of 3 years' detention. That sentence will take effect from the date on which Scott Cartwright surrenders or is apprehended pursuant to the warrant which has been issued. We direct that he surrender at Longsight police station by 4.00 pm today. We add for completeness that the time previously spent on remand in custody will of course count towards the sentence which we have now imposed.
46.
Mr Jarvis, Mr Holland, thank you both for your assistance.

J U D G M E N T
LORD JUSTICE GOLDRING:
1. On 29 October 2009, in the Crown Court at Peterborough, the appellant was convicted of assault by penetration contrary to
section 2(1)
of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
. He was subsequently sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Having been convicted of an offence listed in Schedule 3 to the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
, he was required to comply with the provisions of Part 2 of
the Act
(notification to the police) for ten years. He was also disqualified indefinitely from working with children. That part of the sentence, it is agreed by both prosecution and defence, was inappropriate in the circumstances.
The appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence by leave of the single judge.
2. On 30 April 2008 the appellant took some intimate photographs of the complainant on his mobile telephone. One image showed the complainant's vagina being penetrated by two of his fingers. On 20 November 2008 he sent the photographs via a text message to the complainant. By then he had transferred the images from his original mobile phone to another one.
3. It was the prosecution's case, and the complainant's evidence, that in 2008 there was no sexual relationship between the two of them, although there had been. It had ended initially in 2005, had resumed in 2007, and had ended it was said, in late 2007. The complainant said that until she received the images she knew nothing about them. She did not consent to the photographs being taken. To her knowledge no photographs were taken. She did not consent to the digital penetration depicted. The photographs must have been taken when she was asleep. Two of the images depicted a condom. In cross-examination the complainant agreed that the images could have been taken after an act of consensual sexual intercourse. There had been occasions when she had consented to sexual intercourse with the appellant when she had been drinking alcohol.
4. The appellant's case was that the complainant had consented to the digital penetration and the photographs being taken. She had posed for them. There was no question of her having been asleep. The day after they were taken she had looked at them. In September 2008 she and the appellant had argued. As a result, a number of the photographs were deleted. Those saved and later transferred to the second mobile phone. Between 10 and 12 November he sent the photographs because at that time the complainant was not talking to him and he thought she would respond.
5. The sole issue in the case was consent. The basis of the appeal is that twice, once in the course of his summing-up and once in response to a question from them, the judge misdirected the jury in relation to
section 75
of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
. The prosecution accept the judge did twice misdirect the jury. The prosecution submit that the conviction is nonetheless safe.
6.
Section 2
of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
provides:
""A person (A) commits an offence if --
(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina…of another person (B) with a part of his body…,
(b)the penetration is sexual,
(c)B does not consent to the penetration, and
(d)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.""
""Consent"" is defined by
section 74
of
the 2003 Act
. It provides:
""For the purposes of this Part, a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice.""
Section 75
, deals with ""Evidential Presumptions about Consent."" It provides:
""(1) If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved --
(a) that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b) that any of the circumstances specified in sub
section (2
) existed, and
(c) that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed,
the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.
(2) The circumstances are that --
....
(d) The complainant was asleep…at the time of the relevant act.""
7. In his summing-up the judge made it clear that the essential issue in the case was consent. He referred the jury to the two aspects in relation to it: first, that there was evidence that the complainant had been drinking; and second, the evidence concerning her having been asleep. He said that consent had freely to be given and could be withdrawn at any time. He reminded them that it was the act of digital penetration which they had to be sure was carried out without the complainant's consent. He said:
""If you find as a fact that the complainant was not asleep then what I say now can be ignored.
That means, if you find as a fact that the defendant is or may be telling the truth that the complainant was not asleep, ignore the following direction.
However, if you conclude that the complainant was asleep,
the Act
states as follows ....""
The judge then set out the words to which we have just referred in
section 75
. He continued:
""In simple terms, that means that if you are satisfied that she was asleep, the law places an evidential burden on the defendant to satisfy you, on the balance of probabilities, that he had a reasonable belief the complainant was consenting.""
The judge did not explain what an ""evidential burden"" was or how the jury was to approach it on the facts of the case. Assuming it was necessary to give the direction at all, that was less than helpful.
8. Following their retirement the jury asked a question. It was in these terms:
""If she gave consent beforehand and then fell asleep during the photo preparation, is the consent still current?""
In response to the jury's question the judge repeated what he had previously said. At the instigation of the prosecution he reminded the jury of
section 75
in exactly the same terms as before. They were not told how, in the light of the factual assumptions in the question, they were to approach the evidential burden. The jury must have found the further directions baffling.
9. There is no doubt, as the prosecution accepts, that sufficient evidence was adduced to raise the issue either that the complainant consented to the digital penetration or that the appellant reasonably believed that she did. The appellant had said so. On the basis of the jury's question, the complainant had in terms agreed to the digital penetration and the taking of photographs but had fallen asleep while the agreement was brought into effect. It was not necessary or in the circumstances appropriate for the judge to give a
section 75
direction.
10. It seems to us that the position is correctly summarised at paragraph B3.19 of the current edition of Blackstone, in which it is said:
""
Section 75
of the
SOA 2003
lists circumstances in which the complainant is taken not to have consented to the relevant act
unless
sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether the complainant consented. Also the accused is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented
unless
sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.
There must be some foundation in the evidence and it must not be merely speculative or fanciful for there to be sufficient evidence. However, it is vital to understand that if the trial judge decides (presumably at the close of the evidence) that there is sufficient evidence to raise an issue as to whether the complainant consented and/or the accused reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting, then the judge will put the issues to the jury in accordance with the key sections (ie 74 and 1(2)), and the
section 75
route is barred. In the relatively rare cases where the judge decides that there is not sufficient evidence on one or both of the issues, a
section 75
direction must be given on that issue.""
11. On the facts of this case, the direction should not have been given in the body of the summing-up. It plainly should not have been given in answer to the jury's question. Moreover, R v Zhang
[2007] EWCA Crim 2018
, which was drawn to our attention by the prosecution, is irrelevant. It was decided on its own facts and in the light of the summing-up there being considered.
12. In our view, it cannot be said this conviction is safe. The judge initially directed the jury inappropriately and in a way which it must have found very difficult to understand. He never explained how the appellant could discharge the burden which was said to be placed upon him. He again directed them inappropriately in response to the jury's question. In neither direction did he tailor what he said to the facts, or, in relation to the question, the facts assumed within it. It seems to us the correct answer to the question would have been that the appellant would have a defence in those circumstances. The jury may well have had the impression that they could convict once they were sure the complainant was asleep.
14. For the reasons we have indicated we have concluded that in all the circumstances the conviction was unsafe.
15. We should add this. As has been accepted before us, the judge did not have the help from counsel he should have had. The prosecution suggested that there should be a
section 75
direction when there should not have been. It repeated that suggestion following the jury's question. Throughout defence never demurred.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
LORD JUSTICE TREACY:
1. On 1st November 2013, in the Crown Court at Swansea, this appellant was convicted of rape. In due course he was sentenced to an extended sentence of ten years, comprising a custodial term of five years with an extension period of five years. He was sentenced to concurrent terms arising from his guilty pleas to two counts of possessing an extreme pornographic image. Ancillary orders were made. The single judge has granted leave to appeal against conviction. We confirm that the usual reporting restrictions concerning the victim in this case apply.
2. The victim was a 27-year-old woman. Both she and the appellant had struggled with drug addiction. They met at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in 2011. On 18th November of that year they began a sexual relationship. There was no dispute that the complainant was attracted to the appellant and quite willing to have a sexual relationship.
3. The Crown's case was that on the evening of 25th November the victim invited the appellant to her home. The pair had consensual oral sex. After this the appellant penetrated her anus with his penis. This had begun consensually but it hurt the victim and she told him to stop. However, he ignored those protests and continued to penetrate her, knowing that she was not consenting. The penetration was hard and fast and went on for several minutes. The appellant ignored the complainant's repeated protests. Indeed, at one point he said, ""I'm anally raping you"". As the jury's verdict showed, this was true.
4. The defence case was that the victim had consented to the anal intercourse, the victim had enjoyed it and had not told him to stop. When she did say it was hurting, he had stopped of his own accord.
5. So the issue for the jury was one of consent, with the credibility of the victim's account being of vital importance.
6. In the course of her ABE interviews, and also through the ordinary and proper disclosure process, it was disclosed to the defence that the complainant had made previous allegations of sexual assault by men other than this appellant. Before any evidence was heard counsel raised with the judge whether he might be permitted to cross-examine her about those matters. The judge gave an initial ruling that since there was no evidence that the allegations were false, such cross-examination should not take place. However, the judge indicated he would leave the matter open and would hear further argument if need be.
7. The complainant's evidence-in-chief consisted of her ABE video interviews, which had been edited by agreement. The allegations of earlier sexual abuse by others were excluded, although the jury did hear brief reference to the fact that the victim had been abused in the past by her father.
8. In the course of the victim's cross-examination, she volunteered that she had been abused in the past by three men. We do not accept the characterisation of this by Mr Edie as representing the introduction of evidence as part of the prosecution case. This was an observation made by the victim in cross-examination voluntarily. This information had not been adduced in chief by the Crown and formed no part of the Crown's case as presented to the jury.
9. In the light of what had happened, Mr Edie again applied to be permitted to cross-examine the victim about those allegations. The judge again ruled against Mr Edie on the basis that there was no evidence that any of the allegations was false. In the course of exchanges between judge and counsel, the judge said:
""... the fact remains the only reason really that you want it in is to say to the jury 'well, how can she be telling the truth if she's been abused by, whether it be three or six people'.""
10. Mr Edie frankly acknowledged that that was the case.
11. The grounds of appeal assert that the conviction is unsafe, and that the judge should have permitted cross-examination of the victim about the falsity of her allegations of sexual abuse by other men. The credit of the victim was critical to the case. There was a basis for allowing the questions to be asked and they would have had a substantive probative value in the case.
12. It is clear that the restrictions on questions about a complainant's sexual history set out in section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 do not apply to previous false complaints of sexual assaults. Cross-examination is permitted since such complaints are not about any sexual behaviour of the complainant within the meaning of section 42(1)(c) of the Act. However, before any such questions are permissible, the defence must have a proper evidential basis for asserting that any such statement was (a) made, and (b) untrue.
13. This court observed in
Murray
[2009] EWCA Crim 618
that the difficulty lies in what constitutes a proper evidential basis. The court said that it was less than a strong factual foundation for concluding that the previous complaint was false, but that there must be some material from which it could properly be concluded that the complainant was false.
14. We agree with the observation that the exercise for the judge is fact-sensitive and will not be assisted by an examination of the facts of other cases. We also agree that it is an exercise of judgment rather than discretion, so that it is for the judge to evaluate the matter on the basis of all the relevant material. The ultimate question is whether the material is capable of leading to a conclusion that a previous complaint was false.
15. Mr Edie contends that in this case there was a proper evidential basis that would enable leave to cross-examine to have been given under section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Accordingly, if a previous complaint or complaints was or were false, it would have substantial probative value as to the appellant's credit, as required by section 100(1)(b).
16. In those circumstances we need to examine the matters relating to the earlier complaints. They are:
(A) complaints of sexual abuse, including rape by her father, on occasions between the ages of two and 16. These were referred to in an ABE interview in April 2012 but had first been disclosed in May or June 2010. The victim had then been interviewed by police after a referral following counselling. When spoken to by the police, she said her recollections were vague. She concluded her interview by stating:
""These memories are so vague that I cannot entirely rely on them myself. I do not feel I could say with any great amount of certainty that these events actually happened and because of this I am not willing to take the matter any further with the police at this time.""
When asked about these matters in April 2012, at the time of the ABE interview in these proceedings, the victim gave some further detail and she also mentioned that she had reported the matter to the police previously and had not divulged everything or pressed charges.
(B) In her ABE interview the victim said that her grandfather had forced her to give him a ""blow job"" when she was about ten. No complaint was made to the police at the time, and by the time of the ABE interview we understand that the grandfather had died.
(C) In the ABE interview the victim said that a man, whom she named, took her to the woods and touched her indecently. She had been interviewed about this in 1996 apparently, about three years after the event. Hampshire police have no record of this complaint.
(D) On 6th August 2004 the victim's mother phoned the police, saying that the victim had been sexually abused. The victim had said to her mother that on 1st August her uncle had exposed himself and grabbed her head, pushing it down onto his penis. He also put his hand down her top. The victim, when seen by the police shortly afterwards, told them that she did not want to make a statement or pursue a complaint and gave a number of reasons. The police did not take the matter further.
17. There was another matter originally raised in the grounds of appeal which it is now accepted was a complaint mistakenly attributed to this complainant due to an error made by a forensic examiner. This further matter need not detain us any more.
18. It is Mr Edie's submission that the material summarised provides a proper evidential basis for showing the falsity of previous complaints. The circumstances show an inherent unlikelihood of unpursued allegations of sexual abuse against a number of men being true. The evidence should have been admitted because the credibility of the complainant was of critical importance and any difference between the issues of consent and credit were reduced to vanishing point in this sort of case: see
R v Funderburk
[1990] 90 Cr App R 466
.
19. We have come to the conclusion that the judge properly came to the decision that the material relied on did not satisfy the necessary evidential test. The mere fact that a complaint is raised and is not pursued does not necessarily mean that a complaint is false. Courts should be ready to deploy a degree of understanding of the position of those who have made sexual allegations. Failure to pursue the complaint does not of necessity show that it is untrue. A rather closer examination of the circumstances is required.
20. In relation to (A), the matters concerning the victim's father had occurred between ten and 24 years previously at the time they were first mentioned to the police. The 2010 record of interview shows the victim's thought processes, which in our judgment do not support a suggestion of a false complaint. As to (B), there is no basis for saying that the allegation was false, and the matter could not be taken further in any event. As to (C), there was no material to show that the complaint was false. As to (D), the complainant gave reasons based on her past experiences as to why she did not want to make or pursue a complaint. They do not, in our judgment, tend to demonstrate that the account which she had given to her mother, and which she had confirmed to the police as accurate, was untrue.
21. None of the individual matters raised begins to provide a basis for an inference or conclusion of a false complaint. In those circumstances there is no advantage to the appellant in seeking to rely on an accumulation of negative results. The fact that there is no instance which begins to show falsity cannot be converted into evidence of falsity by the fact that complaints have been raised more than once. An earlier example of this approach being applied by the court is
Etches
[2004] EWCA Crim 1313
.
22. In the circumstances, and for the reasons given, the submissions made by Mr Edie cannot succeed. Accordingly, this appeal against conviction is dismissed.","citation:

appeared on behalf of the
Appellant

J U D G M E N T
1.
THE RECORDER OF MIDDLESBROUGH: On 8 May 2014 at the Crown Court at Chester at a preliminary hearing, this appellant pleaded guilty to two offences. Subsequently on 23 October he was sentenced as follows: in respect of count 1, burglary of a dwelling house, 28 months; in respect of theft of a motor car taken at the same time as the burglary, 2 years consecutive to the 28 months, bringing about a total sentence of 4 years and 4 months. He appeals against that sentence with the leave of the single judge.
2.
The facts of the case can be briefly summarised as follows. The appellant lived in Manchester. He travelled to the countryside of Cheshire, and in particular the village of Bollington, he was to say for social purposes, going for a night out in nightclubs. The learned judge found as a fact that it was in order to carry out these offences.
3.
He entered the complainant's home. He entered through an apparently insecure patio door. This was in the early hours, certainly between the hours of 3 am when the householder was awake with his then sick child and 7.30 am when the appellant escaped and was observed by a neighbour. Once in the house he stole a handbag, taking from it money. He also stole a key to the car which he then subsequently drove away. That was a Volkswagen Golf, valued at £17,000. The rest of the contents of the handbag were scattered on the patio floor. He stole a smartphone and a tablet.
4.
The car was subsequently found in Manchester shortly afterwards with new plates. It may be said that it was stolen to order. The neighbour saw the car being driven away in company with another car, it was said being driven by the appellant's then girlfriend. Accordingly, this was an offence which was committed by two people and the learned judge was entitled to say planned. That car, his car, was to be seen on closed-circuit television. It was traced to his home address. That was searched and some of the stolen property was found.
5.
As to the defendant's antecedents, he was 22 at the time. He has 21 offences bringing about 10 convictions. When he was but 15, on 20 June 2007 he was convicted at the Minshull Street Crown Court for conspiracy to burgle. That, we are told by his counsel today, involved a ""home invasion"", and it resulted in his being sentenced to a detention and training order of 18 months. On 10 December 2012 he committed a dwelling house burglary which resulted in a sentence of 22 months. He was released from that sentence in December 2013. This offence for which he was sentenced was not, however, the subject of a mandatory minimum term because conspiracy to burgle does not qualify.
6.
But that was not the end of his offending. He has a number of offences of taking without consent, including aggravated taking without consent, and in 2011 he served a sentence of 3 years for robbery. In other words, for someone so young, he has a very bad record indeed.
7.
In his sentencing observations, the learned judge said this:
i.
""It is quite plain from the evidence that you came up from Manchester with another vehicle and another or other persons intent on crime and in the early hours of the morning you came upon the unfortunate occupants of 19 Princes Drive in Bollington.""
8.
He found that the sentences should be ordered to run consecutively.
9.
In his grounds of appeal, the appellant makes a number of points. He said that the learned judge failed to take account of the defendant's contention, not disputed by the Crown, that this was not a targeted offence of burglary, the defendant travelling away from his home area to commit the offence; rather, it was an opportunistic offence It was said that the defendant, whilst a passenger in his co-defendant's vehicle, was driving around , after spending time socialising in nightclubs and, stopping to urinate, saw the opportunity of a door being open and took from the porch the keys, hence the theft of the motor vehicle. That was an account and a contention which the learned judge did not accept, and we can well understand why he was not prepared to accept it.
10.
It is further said in the grounds of appeal that the total sentence was excessive and the two sentences should not have been ordered to run consecutively.
11.
Thirdly, a point is made as follows: that the judge should have taken into account the fact that the appellant's time spent in custody from arrest to sentence as a result of his being recalled on licence would not be deducted from his sentence. It is said that as a result of the commission of this offence, whilst subject to a licence the defendant was recalled to custody to serve the remaining balance of that sentence. Mr Palmer accepts that, whilst this submission, at first blush is far from attractive, indeed is an aggravating feature of the offence, the consequent result is that the sentence imposed by the learned judge on 23 October 2014 will not begin to run until after the expiry of the licence period. In the result, the applicant's estimated date of release has been provided as 22 December 2016.
12.
We remind ourselves of the decision of this court presided over by the Vice President in
R v Kerrigan & Anor
[2014] EWCA Crim 2348
, where at paragraph 57:
i.
""Applying those principles to the facts here, the appellants do not qualify for any automatic reduction in their sentences. They breached their licence, they were recalled to serve the balance, or part of the balance, of an existing sentence and they were, therefore, detained pursuant to a custodial sentence for most, if not all, the time they were on remand in relation to the subsequent offence. In those circumstances Parliament's intention is clear: a day counts as time served in relation to only one sentence. Section 240ZA prohibits double counting. Unless, therefore, the appellants can bring themselves within the judge's general discretion to do justice, the periods they spent on remand which coincided with time spent in custody on recall should not be counted twice.""
13.
There is no grounds for the learned judge and now us exercising our discretion, and therefore we find no merit in that ground of appeal.
14.
Although the appellant did not qualify for the mandatory sentence of 3 years, the learned judge was perfectly entitled to take into account the fact that this was the third offence involving burglary of a dwelling houses. Further, from the facts of the earlier offence, the appellant was clearly a man who was prepared to commit burglary, and in doing so was prepared for a confrontation with the homeowners if needs be, hence the offence of conspiracy which amounted, as we have said, to a ""home invasion"". He committed these offences whilst on licence, which was a clear and obvious aggravating feature to the offence. The learned judge was perfectly entitled to sentence on the basis that the appellant drove from Manchester to commit burglary in the area of Cheshire.
15.
There can be no argument that this was a category 1 offence: it was committed by a professional criminal; the occupants were at home and the value of the property taken, which includes the value of the car, was clearly significant. Further, it is an offence of high culpability. There was, in our judgment, a clear finding that the learned judge was entitled to find a significant degree of planning and/or organisation. He came from Manchester with others to commit this offence and to steal high-value motor cars. The fact that he was not alone was a further factor which places this in the category of higher culpability. There were further aggravating factors: his previous convictions; these offences were committed on licence; a child was at home; and the offence was committed at night.
16.
Category 1 has a starting point of 3 years with a range of 2 to 6 years. As my Lord, Pitchford LJ, has indicated, there are certainly (and this court has indicated that there are) occasions when the number and extent of the aggravating factors can extend the range upwards. This is such a case. The number and extent of the aggravating features are such as to place this above the category with an upper range of 6 years. We would not have ordered the sentences to run consecutively. However, in all the circumstances, we take the view that the appropriate starting point of 6 1/2 years taken by the judge was not manifestly excessive. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.","citation:

2. The offender is Zekel Watson. He is 22 years of age. He has no convictions since the age of 13 (which we treat as irrelevant for present purposes). On 3 December 2009, in the Crown Court at Birmingham, before His Honour Judge Creed, he pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited firearm. He was jointly charged with two co-defendants. We say nothing about the allegations against them. They are facing trial on a number of different matters.
3. The offender was charged on an indictment containing two counts. The first, to which he pleaded guilty, charged possessing a prohibited firearm. The second, of which he was subsequently acquitted by a jury, charged possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
4. In summary, on 8 September 2009 the police stopped a car being driven by the offender. The two co-defendants were passengers in the car. In the boot of the car, tucked away, the police found a sawn-off shotgun which was loaded with a 12 bore cartridge. The boot also contained, among other things, a knife, a pair of rubber gloves and a further live shotgun cartridge.
5. Taking it in more detail, the three co-defendants met up in Perry Bar, a suburb of Birmingham. The offender and one of the other two arrived at the meeting point first in a black BMW Mini, which the offender was driving. The third defendant arrived in his own car. He left his car and joined the offender and the co-defendant in the black BMW car. The trial proceeded on the basis that the Crown alleged that one of the co-defendants was seen to put something into the boot of the offender's car before he joined the other two inside it. The Crown's case was that it was the sawn-off shotgun with which we are concerned that was put into the boot. That evidence was challenged at the trial. The offender gave evidence that he had received the gun two days earlier. Following the jury's verdict, it was decided that he should be sentenced on the basis of his own account of these matters. We must underline that, even if that was so, we are far from certain that this reduced his culpability.
6. The three co-defendants set off on a journey from Perry Bar towards Hertfordshire. After they had driven for almost two hours, the police stopped the car. They found the shotgun wrapped in plastic bags hidden in the spare wheel compartment in the boot. It was a shortened, single-barrelled shotgun. Its serial number had been erased. The offender's fingerprint was on the outside of one of the plastic bags. Police also found a satellite navigation system in the car with a destination post code apparently entered into it. The post code was very close to the place where the offenders had been stopped. A piece of paper containing a name, address, telephone number and the same post code was found on one of the co-defendants. It is plain that the offenders were delivering a lethal, loaded weapon to somebody.
7. When he was interviewed the offender said that the BMW he had been driving was his mother's car. It was driven by her and sometimes his younger sister was a passenger. He had arranged to meet up with the co-defendants that day. During the drive he had noticed the satellite navigation system. He had not inserted the destination post code into it. He had started to follow the directions, but had not asked the other two why they should be driving in that direction or as to the place they intended to go. He denied knowing that there was a firearm in the boot of the car.
8. The co-defendants similarly said that they had no knowledge of the firearm, or the destination, or the purpose of the drive. On one view, nobody in the car knew anything about the gun.
9. At his trial the offender gave evidence. He said that two days before the car was stopped he had been approached by an associate. He knew him by the street name ""Inferno"", but his first name was Leon. He had asked the offender to keep a gun for him. Although he had wanted to refuse, Leon was very persistent. This was the first mention of Leon that the offender had made. No further information was given. We understand that the information has not been sufficient for the police to be able to investigate further.
10. The judge considered a pre-sentence report. The offender is a bright young man. He lives with his mother and younger sister. He is studying at a university, where he had completed the first year of a degree course. According to the author of the pre-sentence repot, on his release from his anticipated sentence the offender's intention was to return to university.
11. The judge decided that there were exceptional circumstances which justified him in imposing a lower sentence than the prescribed sentence for this offence. In due course he sentenced the offender to a total of three and a half years' imprisonment. In reaching his conclusion that that was appropriate, he took account of his view that the offender had been unwilling to take possession of the weapon, that he had given a full explanation of how this had all come about, and had identified the person who had given the weapon to him. The judge took account of the fact that the weapon was in the family car which, in the context of cases like this, he held was an exceptional circumstance.
12. We find nothing exceptional about the offender's apparent unwillingness to possess the gun. The judge was entitled to make the finding of unwillingness, but it is often the case that young men and women of apparently good character are persuaded, cajoled, encouraged and sometimes pressurised into carrying, or holding, or looking after these lethal weapons. They are chosen for that purpose because it is unlikely that the police will have any interest in them, and so those who own the weapons can keep them safe and secure. The offender knew what he was doing. We find nothing in his evidence to suggest that he was under duress. Nor do we find anything in the evidence to suggest that he provided information on the kind of scale which would have enabled the police to hunt down and identify the men who had provided the weapon. We are also deeply concerned that the fact that the car in which the gun was found was used by the offender's mother and sister was treated as a mitigating factor. On one view it is an aggravating feature, if for no other reason than it might have implicated his mother and sister.
13. The aggravating features of this case need no recitation. The offender was convicted of possession of a loaded, sawn-off shotgun which was on its way to be delivered to someone. The fact that that individual may not for present purposes be identified does not diminish the seriousness of the fact that the gun was to be handed over in a condition where it was capable of being used immediately and certainly capable of being used in the course of gun crime.
14. This offence cried out for the imposition of at least the minimum prescribed statutory sentence. We do not think that the offender could have had any complaint if the sentence had been longer than it was. We have reflected on the situation as it stands before us now, having been before the Crown Court and having been dealt with as it was. We shall quash the sentence imposed by the judge and substitute for it a sentence of five years' imprisonment.

MR P WORMALD
appeared on behalf of the Appellant
_________
J U D G M E N T
LADY JUSTICE CARR:
1.
This is an appeal against sentence limited to a single ground of appeal, namely that the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient credit for the appellant's guilty plea. We can take matters very shortly.
2.
On 24 June 2021 the appellant appeared in custody before Cardiff Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty to an offence of attempted burglary (of a non-dwelling, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 committed on the previous day, 23 June 2021. The offence was committed during the operational period of two suspended sentences that had earlier been imposed in the Crown Court. The appellant was committed to Cardiff Crown Court for sentencing, pursuant to section 14 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and paragraph 11(2), Schedule 16 Sentencing Act 2020.
3.
On 22 July 2021 Mr Recorder Bull QC (""the Recorder"") sentenced him on the offence of attempted burglary to 12 months' custody (after applying 25% credit for guilty plea). The suspended sentences were activated with reduced terms of seven and five months' imprisonment to run consecutively. The overall sentence was thus one of 24 months' imprisonment.
4.
Section 72 of the Sentencing Code created by the Sentencing Act 2020 requires a court sentencing an offender who has pleaded guilty to take into account:
""(a) the stage in the proceedings for the offence at which the offender indicated the intention to plead guilty, and
(b) the circumstances in which the indication was given.""
5.
The Sentencing Council Guideline on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea (""the Guideline"") sets out the principles to be followed in reducing the punitive aspects of a sentence by reason of a guilty plea. Clarification has been provided recently by this court in
R v Plaku and others
[2021] EWCA Crim 568
;
[2021] 4 WLR 82
. There, the court emphasised amongst other things (at [6]):
That by section 59 of the Sentencing Code (formerly section 125 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009) a court must follow any relevant sentencing guideline unless satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so;
That the Guideline, like section 73 of the Sentencing Code, focuses on the time when the guilty plea is indicated, not when it is entered;
That a clear distinction is deliberately drawn between the reduction in sentence available at the first stage of proceedings and the reduction available at any later stage.
6.
As set out above, the appellant here indicated - and indeed entered - his guilty plea the day after the offence at his first appearance in the Magistrates' Court. There can be no question but that that was the first stage of the proceedings as identified in the guideline. He was therefore entitled to a reduction of one-third, unless the court was satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the Guideline.
7.
The only reason that we can identify for the Recorder's decision to allow only 25% credit was that the appellant was caught ""red-handed after a chase by the police"". He went on to say that he was ""nevertheless"" prepared to give a discount of 25 per cent. This is consistent with what Mr Wormald (who appears before us, as he appeared for the appellant below) tells us: when Mr Wormald questioned the level of credit with the Recorder, the Recorder responded by saying that the prosecution case was ""overwhelming"".
8.
The Guideline identifies the benefits of a guilty plea as follows:
That a guilty plea normally reduces the impact of the crime upon victims;
That a guilty plea saves victims and witnesses from having to testify; and
That a guilty plea is in the public interest in that it saves public time and money on investigations and trials.
The earlier the plea the greater these benefits.
9.
The Guideline states in terms that those benefits apply regardless of the strength of the evidence against an offender. Thus:
""…The strength of the evidence should
not
be taken into account when determining the level of reduction.""
10.
The Recorder did not indicate that there was any basis on which to conclude that it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to follow the Guideline, nor can we identify any.
11.
We therefore have no hesitation in concluding that the sentence of 12 months' imprisonment imposed was wrong in principle. It will be quashed. Based on a term of 16 months, one arrives at a sentence of 11 months' custody after credit of one-third. A sentence of 11 months' imprisonment will accordingly be substituted in its place. This may not be a very significant reduction from 12 months, but the appellant is entitled to it as a matter of principle. The proper application of the Guideline demands it. All other elements of the sentences remain in place, in particular the activation of the suspended sentences is not affected. The overall sentence is therefore now one of 11 months' custody, followed by 12 months' custody, with a total custodial period of 23 months.

Judgment
THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
1. This appeal comes before the court as a reference by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in respect of the appellant's conviction at Lewes Crown Court before Miss Recorder Chalmers. The conviction arises out of a conviction on the appellant's plea of guilty to possession of false identity documents, contrary to
section 25(1)(a)
of the
Identity Cards Act 2006
.
2. The basis of the appeal is that those who advised the appellant failed to give any, or any proper, advice in relation to the defence which commonly arises in such cases in relation to those who are fleeing from other countries.
3. The background can be shortly stated, as can the law. The law is to be found in the decision of this court given by Leveson LJ (as he then was) in
R v Mateta and Others
[2013] EWCA Crim 1372
.
4. The appellant was a citizen of Iran. He engaged in various activities there which plainly would have given rise to the question of whether he had been involved in political activities. It is unnecessary to set out the detail. He left Iran in circumstances where it was plain on his account of matters that he would be arrested for the activities in which he had been engaged. He travelled via Turkey to Spain and then to London Gatwick. He told the immigration officers of his visit to Turkey, and he said that he had been in another country. It is clear from the facts that have now emerged that he had been in Spain for eleven days. On arrival at Gatwick on 19
th
January he was stopped by an immigration officer and his passport (a Lithuanian passport) was examined. Although it was in his name and contained his photograph, it was obviously a false passport. He was interrogated and enquiries were made by the immigration officer.
5. As will be obvious from that account, he was advised by a duty solicitor. We do not name the duty solicitor, but his competence was such that he did not even appreciate that there might be any defence to someone in those circumstances.
6. On 4
th
February 2011, in the Crown Court at Lewes, the appellant pleaded guilty to possession of a false identity document, as we have set out. It appears that at least the person who advised him on that occasion knew of the defence, but he wholly failed to give the appellant proper advice. As a result, the appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. An order was made that he was subject to deportation, pursuant to the Borders Act 2007.
7. His case was referred to the First Tier Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber. In a judgment, which we have, the Tribunal very carefully considered all the evidence and concluded that the appellant had been at risk of persecution in Iran and that he left Iran because he was wanted in connection with a criminal offence for conducting his political activities. He had also converted to Christianity after arrival in the United Kingdom. It was concluded that he would have been at risk and that therefore it would not be right to remove him. In consequence, he was granted asylum and given five years leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
8. In November 2012 the appellant took his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission which, with their usual thoroughness, examined it and referred the matter to this court on 1
st
December 2014.
9. It is plain that if the appellant had been advised properly in relation to the appropriate article of the Refugee Convention 1951 and
section 31 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999
he would have had an arguable defence with a realistic prospect of success before this court. Evidence would have been needed in relation to the political activities and the risk of persecution that he suffered, and there would have had to be evidence as to whether, under
section 31(2)
he was still in flight.
10. We have looked carefully at the evidence in relation to both of the issues. It is plain in relation to the question as to whether he was at risk of persecution for his political activities that the evidence that was before the First Tier Tribunal, and which was accepted by the judge of the Tribunal, would have given rise to a defence with a reasonable prospect of success before the jury.
11. As regards the issue under
section 31(2)
, it provides:
""If, in coming from the country where his life or freedom was threatened, the refugee stopped in another country outside the United Kingdom, subsection (1) applies only if he shows that he could not reasonably have expected to be given protection under the Refugee Convention in that other country.""
12. The issue in this case would have been whether the time that the appellant spent in Spain was time spent in the course of the flight. In our judgment, having looked at the facts and been taken to the evidence that was available, there was plainly a reasonable prospect of him persuading a jury that he was in the course of flight.
13. In the result, therefore, it is clear that the Reference by the Criminal Cases Review Commission set forth a very powerful case as to why this court should review the matter. We have been greatly assisted this morning by Mr Bunting, who has appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Mr Douglas-Jones who has appeared on behalf of the Crown. Mr Douglas-Jones has accepted that in the circumstances which we have briefly outlined, and applying the principles set out in
Mateta
, that this is a case where we should plainly allow the appeal and quash the conviction.
14. There is, however, one serious matter. As a result of the incompetent advice given by the duty solicitor, and more seriously by the solicitor who represented the appellant when he was before the Crown Court, the appellant spent time unnecessarily in prison. It has led to the cost of his detention in prison, the investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and the appearance of two counsel before us today.
15. It is unacceptable that such advice was given which plainly did not pass a standard of competence. It seems to us that people in the position of this appellant, and the system as a whole, are entitled to expect that those who advise in circumstances such as this should be familiar with the law. There can be little excuse for a failure to understand the law and advise properly. We therefore consider that this is a case where we should refer both the duty solicitor and the solicitor who represented the appellant at the hearing to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority for them to consider whether any proper sanction is to be taken against them.
16. The criminal justice system cannot afford the kind of incompetence that was displayed in this case; nor can we as a nation afford to have lawyers who act so incompetently that someone wrongly spends a considerable amount of time in prison. We have not named the advisers because to do so would be to pre-judge the decision of the Solicitors Regulatory Authority. But if the Solicitors Regulatory Authority find, after they have had a chance properly to investigate the matter, that they breached the levels of competence required, they will be named on that occasion.

THE VICE PRESIDENT:
2.
Background
3.
The applicant appeared at the Blackfriars Crown Court charged jointly with Junior Owusu-Sekyere and Kadeem Simon Brown with an offence of robbery. Brown pleaded guilty. On 5th October 2015 the appellant and Owusu-Sekyere were convicted. The issue for this court is whether Brown's plea of guilty should have been admitted in evidence at the appellant's trial.
4.
We can state the facts briefly. Mr Luck and his friend Mr Desiato were walking along Islington High Street, looking for a taxi, in the early hours of the morning when they were approached by a group of four men: the three accused, and a fourth man (arrested but not charged). The encounter was captured on CCTV.
5.
The appellant accused Mr Luck of having thrown water over him. Mr Luck denied having done so. According to Mr Luck, the men became more aggressive, surrounded him and separated him from his friend. They told him he could not ‘get away with’ what he had done and he should tell them who threw the water or he would have to pay. One of the men, whom he described as ""the Turkish guy"" (agreed to be the appellant), punched him hard to the side of the face and, with the others, pushed him towards a cash machine, demanding he pay them £250. He was threatened that if he did not go to the cash point he would be stabbed and killed. He withdrew £100, which he gave to the appellant. Brown demanded his bank card and PIN. His bank records later revealed that two amounts of £100 were withdrawn from his account followed by several unsuccessful attempts to withdraw a further £50.
6.
The appellant gave evidence at trial that he had gone to Upper Street to get something to eat with his co-accused. In the queue at the hot dog stand he and Owusu-Sekyere were hit by liquid. He asked Mr Luck and Mr Desiato who had thrown the water. They denied responsibility but he refused to accept their answer and kept asking them who was responsible. He threw a punch at the victim, he claimed in self-defence because the victim had ""invaded his personal space"" and waved his arms. He said he overheard a conversation between Mr Luck and Brown in which Mr Luck offered compensation of £50 for his wet hoodie. He, the appellant, insisted on £250. He saw Mr Luck and Mr Brown at the cash point. He believed Mr Luck was withdrawing the money he had offered. He did not threaten Mr Luck at any time, he did not see or hear Brown make any threat. When Mr Luck gave him £100, he protested the agreement was for £250, and so Mr Luck withdrew another £100. Mr Luck claimed he had reached his limit, handed the appellant his cash card, told him his PIN and invited him to check that was the case. The appellant then tried to withdraw £50 but found he had been given the incorrect PIN. By this time the victim had left. Owusu-Sekyere then tried to withdraw £200 from the victim's account.
7.
Admission of guilty plea
8.
At the outset of the trial the prosecution applied to admit Brown's plea of guilty into evidence pursuant to section 74 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”). The Recorder considered the matter overnight and provided a very carefully structured and thorough ruling. He referred to the relevant passages in Archbold and decisions put before him by Miss Smart in
R v Kempster
[1990] 90 Cr App R 14
,
R v Nathan Smith
[2007] EWCA Crim 2105
, and case comment on the decision in
R v Curry
[1988] Crim LR 527. He ruled that the guilty plea was relevant to an issue in the case: it was evidence that Brown committed the robbery and it was relevant to whether his co-accused did so. He then considered whether the guilty plea should not be admitted because of its adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. He reminded himself he must balance any potential unfairness to the appellant against the potential unfairness to the prosecution and the wider interests of justice. It was his judgment that a failure to allow the evidence to be admitted would allow the appellant to present a false defence that neither he nor Brown had committed an offence. He applied the test under section 78 of PACE and asked himself whether admitting the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the trial that otherwise relevant and admissible evidence should be excluded. Whilst he acknowledged the admission of the guilty plea made it more difficult for the appellant to assert there was no robbery, he did not accept that admission of the plea would deprive him of a defence. It was left open to the appellant to argue that, to his knowledge, there was no robbery and that he participated in no robbery.
9.
Grounds of Appeal
10.
The grounds of appeal advanced by Miss Smart, in helpful and succinct submissions both orally and in writing, focused on the judge's allowing Brown’s guilty plea to be admitted in evidence. Even if the plea was relevant and admissible under section 74, it was her contention it should have been excluded under section 78.
11.
Section 74 provides, where relevant:
12.
""In any proceedings the fact that a person other than the accused has been convicted of an offence by or before any court in the United Kingdom or by a Service court outside the United Kingdom shall be admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where to do so is relevant to any issue in those proceedings, that that person committed that offence, whether or not any other evidence of his having committed that offence is given.""
13.
Section 78(1) provides:
14.
""In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.""
15.
Ms Smart took us through a number of decisions of this court on the application of s.74, as she had with the trial judge. The most helpful recent summary of those decisions appears in the case of
Nathan Smith.
Although the court noted that the line of cases considered had been decided before the passing of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (“CJA”), which extended the ambit of evidence ‘with which a jury can be trusted,’ it did not follow the decisions were out of date. Section 74 should be “sparingly applied"". The reason given at paragraph 16 is:
i.
""... because the evidence that a now absent co-accused has pleaded guilty may carry in the minds of the jury enormous weight, but it is nevertheless evidence which cannot properly be tested in the trial of the remaining defendant. That is particularly so where the issue is such that the absent co-defendant who has pleaded guilty could not, or scarcely could, be guilty of the offence unless the present defendant were also. In both those situations the court needs to consider with considerable care whether the evidence of the conviction would have a disproportionate and unfair effect upon the trial. With those cases can be contrasted the kind of case in which there is little or no issue that the offence was committed, and the real live issue is whether the present defendant was party to it or not. In those circumstances, commonly, the pleas of guilty of other co-defendants can properly be admitted to reinforce the evidence that the offence did occur, leaving the jury independently to consider whether the guilt of the present defendant is additionally proved.""
16.
Thus, the focus of the court remains: what is the issue to which the guilty plea is said to be relevant? Would the admission of the plea of guilty of a now absent co-defendant have an unfair impact upon the fairness of the trial by closing off much or all of the issues? (See paragraph 17). On the facts of
Nathan Smith
the court concluded that it did. The court was also critical of the judge’s directions to the jury to the effect that the only significance of the co-defendant’s plea was that the girl had admitted her guilt. If that was so, the requirements of section 74 (by which the judge had purported to admit the evidence) had not been met.
17.
Miss Smart does not submit that the Recorder’s directions here were wrong; he directed them in clear terms that (pursuant to s.74) the plea of guilty was admissible to prove that Brown had committed the offence of robbery. However, she maintained that simply by admitting the evidence, the judge has effectively closed off the issue that the jury had to try. She had no opportunity to challenge Brown or test the basis upon which he pleaded guilty. The fact that he was guilty of robbery meant that the appellant must have been involved with him. The appellant's case was inextricably bound up with that of Brown. Brown could not have been guilty of robbery simply by standing by the cashpoint and adding his threatening presence unless the appellant was in the process of committing a robbery. Accordingly, if Brown was guilty of the offence, the jury would inevitably conclude that so must the appellant be. No directions could rectify the unfairness to the appellant.
18.
Conclusions
19.
As in the case of
Smith
, we have no doubt that the evidence of Brown's plea of guilty was relevant and admissible at the appellant's trial. It went to the issue of whether there was a robbery. The question for us, however, is whether its admission into evidence has closed off the very issue that the jury had to try and should therefore have been excluded under section 78. In our view, on the facts of this case, it did not. There were up to four people allegedly involved in the robbery. Words may have been uttered and threats issued not heard by all. It did not follow from the plea of one of the four that all four must be guilty.
20.
The appellant's case throughout, from the defence case statement to his evidence at trial, was that, whatever Brown and others were up to, he was not involved in a robbery. As far as he was concerned, Mr Luck was withdrawing cash to hand to him as compensation for his wet hoodie. He insisted he was unaware of any threats and that any violence in which he had been involved had been in the course of self-defence. The evidence of Brown's plea did not remove that defence from him. It was open to Miss Smart to argue on his behalf that even if Brown was a robber, the jury could not be sure the appellant was also one. Even if Miss Smart's task was made more difficult by the admission of the plea, as she claims, she still had a defence to run. The fact that the appellant's account lacked credibility had nothing to do with Brown's plea.
21.
Accordingly, although the individual members of this court would not have agreed to the plea of guilty being admitted in evidence, and we understand why the single judge has given leave, we were not persuaded the trial judge fell into error. It was open to him to admit the plea of guilty.
22.
Even if we had been satisfied that the judge had fallen into error in admitting the plea, the ultimate question for us is whether the conviction is unsafe. It is not. The evidence was overwhelming: the incident was captured on CCTV and the appellant admitted punching Mr Luck for no obvious reason and when he was under no real threat. Further, the idea that Mr Luck would have been prepared to pay £250 for spilling water on the appellant’s hoodie and would have willingly left his credit card and pin number behind or that the appellant could have thought, even in drink, that he was entitled to £250 for a wet hoodie, stretches credulity to breaking point. The defence, as the prosecution at trial argued, bears all the hallmarks of the appellant having fabricated a story to meet the objectively verifiable facts, namely the appellant’s aggressive behaviour caught on camera and the withdrawals and attempted withdrawals from Mr Luck’s bank account. We doubt the jury would have placed any great reliance on Brown's plea, they could see for themselves the circumstances in which Mr Luck's money and card were taken.
23.
For all those reasons, therefore, as indebted as we are to Miss Smart for her submissions, and to Mr MacLean-Watt for stepping into the breach at the last moment for today’s hearing, this appeal must be dismissed.","citation:

Lord Justice Pill:
1.
On 24 March 2000 in the Crown Court at Southwark before His Honour Judge Focke QC, Kamlesh Soneji pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiracy to convert property and remove it from the jurisdiction knowing or suspecting it represented the proceeds of criminal conduct. On 3 April 2000 David Bullen pleaded guilty to the same offence. On 18 August 2000 Soneji was sentenced to 4½ years imprisonment, varied on appeal to 3½ years imprisonment, and Bullen to 6 years imprisonment, varied on appeal to 5 years imprisonment. On 28 January 2002, at the Central Criminal Court before the same judge, a confiscation order was imposed on Soneji. He was ordered to pay £75,350 payable within 18 months with 12 months imprisonment consecutive to be served in default. That order was varied on 7 February 2002 to payment of £30,284 with 9 months imprisonment in default. On 7 February a confiscation order was imposed on Bullen. He was ordered to pay £375,000 with 21 months imprisonment consecutive in default.
2.
A co-defendant Louis Everson was also convicted and on 18 August 2000 sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. An appeal against conviction was dismissed. On 7 February 2002 a confiscation order was imposed on him. He was ordered to pay £200,000 with 18 months imprisonment consecutive in default.
3.
Soneji and Bullen appeal against sentence, the confiscation order only, by leave of the single judge. This is yet another case in which the lawfulness of confiscation orders is challenged on the ground that they were made more than “six months beginning with the date of conviction”, a period of time mentioned in
section 72
A of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
(“
the 1988 Act
”), as amended. Many authorities were cited to the Court. In the course of the hearing, further very recent cases were brought to the attention of counsel and it also became known that a five judge court had been convened to consider whether an earlier judgment which had been relied on was reached
per incuriam
. The Court has received extensive post-hearing written submissions from the parties. There can rarely have been such judicial output upon what would appear to be a comparatively straightforward question, that is, when, in relation to the date of conviction, a Court is entitled to make a confiscation order against the convicted person. There have been increasingly complex attempts, including submissions in the present case, to reconcile the authorities.
4.
Section 71(1)
of
the 1988 Act
provides, insofar as is material:
“(1)
Where an offender is convicted, in any proceedings before the Crown Court or a magistrates’ court, of an offence of a relevant description, it shall be the duty of the court—
(a)
if the prosecutor has given written notice to the court that he considers that it would be appropriate for the court to proceed under this section, or
(b)
if the court considers, even though it has not been given such notice, that it would be appropriate to proceed,
to act as follows before sentencing or otherwise dealing with the offender in respect of that offence or any other relevant criminal conduct.
(1A)
The court shall first determine whether the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct.
(1B)
Subject to subsection (1C) below, if the court determines that the offender has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct, it shall then—
(a)
determine in accordance with subsection (6) below the amount to be recovered in his case by virtue of this section, and
(b)
make an order under this section ordering the offender to pay that amount.”
5.
By the
Criminal Justice Act 1993
, a new section,
section 72
A, was inserted into
the 1988 Act
. That section, as further amended and insofar as is material, provides:
“(1)
Where a court is acting under
section 71
above but considers that it requires further information before—
(a)
determining whether the defendant has benefited from any relevant criminal conduct; or
(b)
[
repealed
];
(c)
determining the amount to be recovered in his case …,
it may, for the purpose of enabling that information to be obtained, postpone making that determination for such period as it may specify.
(2)
More than one postponement may be made under subsection (1) above in relation to the same case.
(3)
Unless it is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, the court shall not specify a period under subsection (1) above which:
(a)
by itself; or
(b)
where there have been one or more previous postponements under subsection (1) above or (4) below, when taken together with the earlier specified period or periods,
exceeds six months beginning with the date of conviction.
(4)
Where the defendant appeals against his conviction, the court may, on that account—
(a)
postpone making any of the determinations mentioned in subsection (1) above for such period as it may specify; or
(b)
where it has already exercised its powers under this section to postpone, extend the specified period.
(5)
A postponement or extension under subsection (1) or (4) above may be made—
(a)
on application by the defendant or the prosecutor; or
(b)
by the court of its own motion.
(6)
Unless the court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, any postponement or extension under subsection (4) above shall not exceed the period ending three months after the date on which the appeal is determined or otherwise disposed of.
(7)
Where the court exercises its power under subsection (1) or (4) above, it may nevertheless proceed to sentence, or otherwise deal with, the defendant in respect of the offence or any of the offences concerned.”
6.
As already stated, Soneji pleaded guilty on 24 March 2000 and Bullen on 3 April 2000, those date being the dates of conviction for the purposes of
the Act
. Sentence was adjourned to await the outcome of the trial of Everson. He was convicted on 25 May and 18
th
August 2000 was fixed as the date when all three defendants would be sentenced. Each of the defendants was informed that there would be confiscation proceedings against him.
7.
The case was listed on 29 June 2000 for an application by counsel for Everson to break the date for sentence but the application was not pursued. Counsel for Soneji and Bullen were present at the hearing, though not counsel who had appeared at the trial or who now appear. The powers of the Court with respect to confiscation proceedings and their application to the facts of the case were considered at that and other hearings. Counsel for Everson (Mr Henry) requested a hearing in September and counsel for Soneji (though not counsel for Bullen) requested an early hearing. The following exchange occurred:
“MR HENRY:
Your Honour, may I deal with it in this way if I might; it has been helpful because all counsel have conferred this morning and have indicated that a final hearing, if it can be accommodated by the Court, or more importantly by your Honour, if it might be held in September. It is right to point out –
JUDGE FOCKE:
The answer is no.
MR HENRY:
Well your honour, it is right to point out.
MR WALBANK:
I am very sorry to interrupt but Mr Henry seems to be proceeding on a false basis about the likely date on which the hearing could be accommodated. It might have been wise, before addressing your Honour on the timetable, to have some discussions, which I have now had, with Ms Benjamin the listing officer.
I understand from her that the earliest date when the hearing could be accommodated would be some time in the two weeks after 30
th
October. That is the first occasion when your honour would be available to hear the confiscation proceedings.”
Mr Walbank told the court of what he understood to be the inherent common law power, in some circumstances, to adjourn or postpone for a period of more than 6 months from conviction but added that “to be completely safe, it would be sensible in my submission, to consider whether there were exceptional circumstances justifying delay”. Dates were fixed for the service of statements.
8.
At the suggestion of counsel for Soneji, the judge directed that the matter was to be mentioned again on the proposed date for sentence, that is 18 August. The judge said that he had “pencilled in” a date “at the beginning of November, the week of 30 October” for the confiscation hearing, a date more than four months away.
9.
On 18 August, the judge sentenced the defendants. Prior to sentence the confiscation hearing was formally postponed until after passing sentence and fixed for 30 October, that is outside the 6 month period mentioned in
section 72
A. The judge also ordered that the defendants should make any response to the prosecution’s statement upon the confiscation order. As the judge stated when he gave a further ruling on 3 November 2000, no enquiry was made on 18 August of the defendants either as to the postponement or as to the fixing of the date of 30 October. The judge added: “There was no analysis of the factors which might amount to exceptional circumstances on that occasion nor how they might separately affect each defendant”.
10.
On 30 October, the prosecution requested a further postponement until a date in the new year. The defendants Soneji and Bullen then objected to the confiscation proceedings on the basis that no proper application had been made within six months. The judge stated in a ruling on 3 November that it had been “plain, by the 18
th
August, that more information was needed in order to enable the confiscation hearing to proceed”. Nevertheless, the judge stated that “the purpose of the order [of 18 August] was not to facilitate the obtaining of further information but, more importantly, to cope with a listing problem and, as I say, listing problems are not sadly exceptional circumstances”. Having considered the authorities the judge stated that “listing difficulties are not exceptional, I am afraid they are somewhat commonplace”. The judge concluded:
“I must, however, before resorting to any common law power, be satisfied that it is not designed to circumnavigate the provisions of
Section 72
A or the intentions of Parliament. In the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the inherent powers can be appropriately and were appropriately used, in that the direction on the 18
th
August was that an adjournment should take place because the hearing should be adjourned until the 30
th
October, pursuant to the Court’s inherent powers.
All parties, for some time before 18
th
August, knew of the listing difficulties and that the only practical solution was to fix the confiscation determination for a hearing on the 30
th
October, with perhaps the first two weeks in November being allocated for that hearing. I am satisfied that the order made directing that hearing on 30
th
October was, in all the circumstances, a just and fair order and the purpose of the order was not to facilitate the obtaining of further information but, more importantly, to cope with a listing problem and, as I say, listing problems are not sadly exceptional circumstances, but there has to be a just and fair solution to such matters and, in the circumstances, it seems to me fair to invoke, as I say, the inherent powers of the Court and, accordingly, I hold that the order made on the 18
th
August was a valid one.”
11.
In a further ruling on 8 March 2001, following the decision of this Court in
R v
Steele and Shevki
[2001] 2 Cr App R (S) 40
, the judge stated that “The standing over of the matter was not to enable more information to be gathered but it was simply because of the unavailability of a judge to hear the proceedings. I am satisfied … that the common law power is still alive and well in such circumstances”.
12.
As further refined in post-hearing written submissions, Mr Walbank’s submissions for the respondent are:
(i)
The unavailability of the judge until after the date six months from the date of conviction constituted “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of
section 72
A(3) of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
and, in accordance with the authority of
R v Chuni
, the requirements of that provision were therefore satisfied.
(ii)
In the alternative, if
section 72
A(3) of
the 1988 Act
was unavailable to the judge to enable him to list the confiscation inquiry according to his availability (either because that period of postponement was not fixed “for the purpose of enabling that [further] information to be obtained” or because the judge’s unavailability did not amount to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of the section), then the court’s inherent common law powers of adjournment were available to fill the statutory lacuna and the listing decision necessitated by the judge’s unavailability was taken pursuant to those common law powers.
(iii)
In the further alternative, once the statutory regime was “engaged” and the court was “acting under
section 71
” of
the 1988 Act
(as the Appellants concede it was, given that the defendants had been convicted of a relevant offence and the prosecution had served written notice) the court had by definition assumed jurisdiction to deal with the confiscation proceedings and it was not thereafter deprived of jurisdiction by any alleged failure to comply with either the requirements of
section 72
A or
the 1988 Act
or any common law requirement.
In support of submission (i), Mr Walbank argues that even though the judge had expressly held that there were no exceptional circumstances, listing problems not being exceptional circumstances, an analysis of the circumstances required or at least permitted a conclusion that there were exceptional circumstances for the postponement beyond the six months.
13.
There have undoubtedly been cases in which this Court has found a common law power to postpone beyond six months to exist, though a stricter view has been taken in other cases. Attempts have been made to reconcile decisions of this Court and in
Steele and Shevki
a comprehensive analysis of the situation was attempted, having regard to the statutory requirements and perceived common law powers. The Court, Judge LJ presiding, stated, at paragraph 58:
“Confiscation orders should normally form part of the ordinary sentencing process. For lack of appropriate information, this will often be impractical. If the conditions in
section 3(1)
or 3(4) [of the
Drug Trafficking Act 1994
] are satisfied, and within six months of conviction, the court may decide that the determination should be postponed. Unless the circumstances are exceptional this should not extend beyond six months after conviction. These decisions involve the court’s discretion, judicially exercised when the statutory conditions are present, taking full account of the preferred statutory sequence as well as the express direction in the statute that save in exceptional circumstances confiscation determinations should not be postponed for more that six months after conviction. So far as practicable, adjournments which would have the effect of postponing the determination beyond that period, or in exceptional cases, beyond the period envisaged when the decision to postpone was made, should be avoided. Nevertheless when the circumstances in an individual case compel an adjournment which would have this effect, then whether or not the information gathering process has been completed, it may be ordered, for example, to take account of illness on one side or the other, or the unavailability of the judge, without depriving a subsequent order for confiscation of its validity,”
A broad view was thus taken of what could be exceptional circumstances, the lengthy trial of a co-accused being given as an example at paragraph 33. In the earlier case of
Cole
(unreported 22 April 1998), Judge LJ again presiding, it was held that the illness of the judge could amount to an exceptional circumstance.
14.
In
R v Sekhon
[2002] EWCA Crim 2954
a comprehensive analysis was conducted, Lord Woolf CJ presiding. It was concluded (paragraph 29) that “we would expect a procedural failure only to result in a lack of jurisdiction if this was necessary to ensure the criminal justice system served the interests of justice and thus the public or where there was at least a real possibility of the defendant suffering prejudice as a consequence of the procedural failure”. The Lord Chief Justice added, at paragraph 37, that “the strict compliance with procedural requirements of this kind [postponement of confiscation proceedings] would not normally be expected to go to jurisdiction”. Failure formally to postpone the confiscation proceedings until after sentence was, however, held to be a requirement going to jurisdiction (paragraph 64).
15.
More recently in
R v Ruddick
2003 EWCA (Crim) 1961, Rose LJ, Vice President presiding, Morison J, giving the judgment of the Court, stated that
Sekhon
“is, and was intended to be, an authoritative ruling on the correct approach to the consequences of a breach of the procedural requirements of the legislation, and
section 72
A in particular”. The Court then made its own very detailed statement of the principles which are to be derived from
Sekhon
. These included, at paragraph 30(3)(c):
“Will a failure to hold a forfeiture hearing within 6 months make any forfeiture order a nullity? If without exceptional circumstances the defendant had not had a forfeiture order made against him within 6 months of the date of postponement, then in our view no such order could lawfully be made. The time limit is there to protect the defendant from unfairness through justice being unduly delayed. Like other limitation periods, Parliament has intended a cut-off date which, subject only to exceptional circumstances, entitles a defendant to be free from the risk of further punishment. The fact that the court is given a limited discretion to extend time beyond that date [‘exceptional circumstances’] supports this view. What are exceptional circumstances may well include administrative matters such as court availability, and judge and defendant availability. But what is ‘exceptional’ is not a matter that can be, or should, be further defined.”
16.
It was in
R v Simpson
[2003] EWCA Crim 1499
, that a five judge court, Lord Woolf CJ presiding, considered, amongst other things, the submission that the decision in
Sekhon
should not be followed because it was contrary to the earlier decision of the Court in
R v Palmer
[2002] EWCA Crim 2202
. The Court held that the law had been misunderstood and misapplied in
Palmer
and that the judgment in
Sekhon
should be applied.
Palmer
was a case in which defective notices under
section 72
of
the 1988 Act
had been served by the prosecution, a point that does not arise in the present case. In was held in
Simpson
that any defects in the notice did not deprive the trial judge of jurisdiction.
17.
We heard considerable argument as to whether, when postponing the confiscation hearing, the judge was acting under
section 72
A or at common law. In his rulings after 30 October, he claimed to have been exercising common law powers but Mr Valios QC, for the appellants, draws attention to the judge’s acceptance that on 18 August more information was needed to enable the confiscation hearing to proceed and submits that, in those circumstances, when the judge postponed that hearing until after sentence he inevitably engaged the statutory provisions. He submits that a common law power to adjourn is only available once the procedure in
section 72
A has been complied with, that is postponement of the determination to a date outside the statutory six month period due to exceptional circumstances.
18.
The statutory provisions not having been complied with, the confiscation orders must be quashed, it is submitted. Whatever was said at a later stage, the purpose of the prosecution application on 18 August 2000 was to postpone the confiscation process in order that further information could be obtained.
19.
In
R v Chuni
[2002] 2 Cr App R 371
, the judge who had tried the defendant and sentenced him was not available due to illness and another judge adjourned the confiscation hearing to a date more than six months after the conviction. The case was a complicated one and the defendant consented to the adjournment. Gibbs J stated:
“It is in our view plain from the decision in
Shevki
and the detail of the passage actually quoted from that decision that there could be no lawful postponement (a) unless there was an actual judicial decision to that effect and (b) if the judicial decision resulted in a postponement beyond the six month period, unless exceptional circumstances existed.
If those conditions were satisfied, was it necessary that the judge making the decision should use the words “exceptional circumstances” in order to render the decision lawful, or could it be enough that the judge relied on proper reasons and that those reasons in fact reflected exceptional circumstances whether that phrase was used or not?
Our answer is that, despite the absence of the words “exceptional circumstances” from the decision, the decision was capable of being lawful under
the Act
. It was lawful provided that a real judicial decision was made on good grounds and that those grounds were capable of, and did amount to, exceptional circumstances. In our judgment there were exceptional circumstances to be found in the reasons given by the judge. It is important to note that the postponements or adjournments were all with the consent of the appellant, as we have already observed. In the vital hearing of March 1999 it is true that the appellant was not present, but it is plain that counsel was instructed on his behalf, but as the decision in the case of
France
indicates, it is an important matter to weigh in considering whether exceptional circumstances existed. In our judgment it is necessary, in deciding the presence or otherwise of exceptional circumstances, to consider the purpose of the legislation. The legislation is plainly intended to protect a defendant in avoiding prejudice to him caused by undue delay in determination. If a defendant’s own interests dictate that the matter be postponed in order for him to obtain further information and make further enquiries, and if he indeed specifically requests an adjournment for that purpose, then that, in our view, is a strong indication that the circumstances are exceptional. In such a case the delay, assumed by the statute as being damaging to his interests, proves in fact quite the reverse. It is necessary in furtherance of his interests. Thus it represents an exception to the statutory assumption. We are satisfied that the judge, in postponing the matter in March 1999 for a period which took it beyond the six month period, was acting lawfully.”
20.
Until the insertion of
section 72
A, a confiscation order, if it was to be made at all, had to be made before “sentencing or otherwise dealing with the offender” (
section 71(1)
). That requirement was to an extent relaxed by the provisions of
section 72
A. It has been held that since the statutory relaxation in
section 72
A has been introduced there is also an inherent common law power to adjourn beyond six months. That the relaxation is a limited one has however been reaffirmed. At paragraph 27 in
Sekhon
Lord Woolf CJ stated:
“In relation to the procedural requirements which Parliament has imposed it is possible fairly readily to come to certain conclusions. These are as follows:
i)
Since
the 1988 Act
was passed, Parliament has been attaching increasing importance to courts being in a position to make confiscation orders. For that reason it has relaxed the requirements of the order having to be made as part of the original sentencing process. In
the 1988 Act
in its unamended form, the court was unable to proceed to sentence until the court had gone through the procedural steps and dealt with confiscation. The subsequent amendments gave the court power to adjourn sentencing but care was taken to specify the limits on the power to postpone its decision to order confiscation. (See
S.28
of
the 1993 Act
and the terms of
S.2
A of
the 1988 Act
inserted by
S.28
.) This process was continued by the 1995 Act which extended the court’s powers.
ii)
Parliament was intent on ensuring that wherever practicable the process of making a confiscation order and sentencing should be linked. It can be readily understood why Parliament should have adopted this course. After all, it is important that the defendant should know as soon as practicable what are the consequences to him of his conviction. Parliament, therefore, when it did relax the requirements did require the court to be satisfied that if it was to grant a postponement or extension there were ‘exceptional circumstances’ to justify this. (see
S.72
A(6))”
21.
In
Steel and Shevki
, Judge LJ, at paragraph 33, stated that the court “may not specify a period which ‘exceeds six months beginning with the date of conviction’ unless satisfied that the circumstances are ‘exceptional’.” The date of conviction remains “starkly relevant”. In
Ruddick
, Morison J stated that “In the absence of ‘exceptional circumstances’ forfeiture cannot be postponed beyond six months.” In
Chuni
, it was stated that there could be no lawful postponement beyond the six month period “unless exceptional circumstances existed”. In the earlier case of
R v Lingham
[2001] 1 Cr App R (S) 158
, relied on in later cases as establishing a more relaxed approach to postponement, it had been held that there were exceptional reasons for further postponing the proceedings (page 161).
22.
That the need for exceptional circumstances applies when the common law power is exercised was stated in
R v October
[2003] EWCA (Crim) 452. Giving the judgment of the court, Scott Baker LJ referred, at paragraph 19, to cases cited with approval in
Sekhon
“as supporting the proposition that the Crown Court retains a general power to postpone or adjourn confiscation proceedings for a period limited only by its own discretion as to whether or not there are special circumstances … .” Scott Baker LJ did refer, at paragraph 22, to an exercise of common law powers “to avoid falling foul of the rule that save in exceptional circumstances the confiscation inquiry must take place within six months of conviction and that an order for postponement cannot be made after the lapse of six months from conviction”. However, the Court’s conclusion, stated in paragraph 27, was:
“On our analysis what happened on 29 January 2001 was that the court exercised the common law power that we have identified earlier in this judgment. The fact that the judge may have thought he was making an order under
section 3
[of
the 1994 Act
] is nothing to the point. What matters is that he exercised his discretion to extend the time for the confiscation proceedings for a period of six months because there were exceptional circumstances. The judge was told that the trial of Bravo was still outstanding and that there were additional defendants involved. Also, there were further investigations in Luxembourg that were incomplete. Mr Casey, who appeared on both occasions for the appellant, expressed uncertainty about whether the incomplete investigations could amount to exceptional circumstances but said that he could not argue against the other point. The court accordingly exercised its powers under the common law, the appellant not yet having appeared to be sentenced, but applied the test prescribed by
section 3
.”
23.
The requirement for exceptional circumstances has thus been imported into the exercise of the common law power. (See also general statement in
Ruddick
cited at paragraph 15).
24.
Thus whether a power to postpone beyond six months from conviction is purported to be exercised under statutory powers or common law powers, there must be a finding of exceptional circumstances. A broad approach may be taken to the question of what may amount to exceptional circumstances (
Steele and Shevki
) and the expression “exceptional circumstances” need not be used (
Chuni
) but specific consideration of the reasons for postponement and a conclusion following that consideration which amounts to a finding of exceptional circumstances are required.
25.
What happened in this case on 29 June has been set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 of this judgment. In circumstances where two of the three defence counsel had requested an early hearing, prosecuting counsel informed the Court that, having spoken to the listing officer, the earliest date when the hearing could be accommodated would be the weeks after 30 October. That date was pencilled in by the judge. Given the importance attached by Parliament and the courts to the link between confiscation order and sentencing, there was no such enquiry as could justify a finding that exceptional circumstances had been established. The say-so of the listing officer is insufficient. That is not a criticism of the listing officer but a recognition of the need for judicial scrutiny of the circumstances before a finding of exceptional circumstances can properly be made. There is no evidence of any enquiry from 24 March 2000 onwards, into whether a space could be found, during the six month period, for a confiscation hearing.
26.
When the judge gave his ruling on 3 November 2000, that is after the six months had elapsed, he acknowledged, with admirable candour if we may say so, that on 18 August when the earlier decision was confirmed, no enquiry was made of the defendants as to the postponement and that there had been no analysis of the factors which might amount to exceptional circumstances. In his later rulings, the judge also candidly acknowledged, more than once, that there were not exceptional circumstances and to go behind that judicial finding would create a sense of injustice. Even if the judge’s finding may be construed as making a general point that listing difficulties are not an exceptional event, so that it might be said that the use of the expression was not itself fatal, the absence of any judicial enquiry and finding upon the circumstances meant that the requirement was not satisfied.
27.
Failure to address the question whether the circumstances could properly be described as exceptional and to make a finding to that effect is in our judgment fatal to the upholding of these confiscation orders. We would respectfully seek to sustain the principle that confiscation orders should not be quashed for mere defects in procedure. To give effect to the requirement that there must be exceptional circumstances, and if the expression is not to be a mere incantation, however, enquiry into the circumstances and the possibility and feasibility of a timely hearing, is required. The failure to address the question whether the general time limit of six months could be met, and the accompanying failure to find exceptional circumstances, was not in the same category as the defect in
Palmer
. To overlook these failures would be to nullify the statutory intention upheld in the cases. It is unfortunate when a confiscation order has to be quashed for defects such as these but it does not serve “the interests of justice and thus the public”, to adopt the expression used by Lord Woolf CJ in
Sekhon
, if the requirement for the existence of exceptional circumstances to justify a postponement beyond six months, is just ignored.
28.
Even if, contrary to the views expressed, the existence of exceptional circumstances is not invariably a pre-requisite of the exercise of the power to postpone or adjourn beyond six months of conviction, any exercise of the power must recognise, in the light of the authorities, the importance of promptness and the consequent need for a judicial appraisal of the circumstances, including those which it is suggested justify delay. A threshold of difficultness must be crossed. In this case, the lack of enquiry into listing difficulties following conviction and on 29 June, when the date of 30 October was pencilled in, and the lack of analysis of the situation then or, as acknowledged by the judge, on 18 August make it unfair to uphold orders eventually made in early 2002.
29.
The appeal is allowed. On the facts of this particular case, the confiscation orders cannot be upheld and must be quashed.","citation:

Mr M Shrimpton appeared on behalf of the Henry's Solicitors

J U D G M E N T
PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION
:
1.
On 12th June 2014, this court, differently constituted, considered a Reference by the Registrar of Criminal Appeals, pursuant to
section 20
of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
, to make a summary determination whether an application for leave to appeal a confiscation order should be dismissed as frivolous or vexatious.
2.
It arose in these circumstances. On 14th June 2011 in the Crown Court at Inner London before His Honour Judge Leeming QC the applicant, Vincent Graham, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs of Class A.
3.
Some 18 months later a confiscation hearing was conducted by His Honour Judge Knowles which received comprehensive written submissions on behalf of the applicant and led to a detailed and comprehensive ruling.
4.
The application for leave to appeal on form NG was completed in the name of Henry's Solicitors 72-74 Wellington South, Stockport, SK1 3SU. The Reference provided was GRA/087/03. The application for leave to appeal was signed ""Mr Mark O'Connor Henry's Solicitors"" after which the address is repeated. The grounds were general and unparticularised; they did not refer to the ruling or the submissions notwithstanding the obvious care that had been put into both. There was no suggestion that counsel instructed at the hearing had been consulted.
5.
On 12th June Mr O'Connor appeared before us, making clear that he was not a solicitor with rights of audience, that the solicitor with conduct of the case was in Stockport Magistrates' Court and that although (as we presumed) he was a legal executive, he was not in a position to consider the detailed merits of the appeal or to address the apparent absence of arguable grounds. It was in those circumstances that we said:
""Given the absence of the solicitors and notwithstanding that the court refused to adjourn the case when asked to do so two days ago, we are driven now to put off the hearing and we will do so on the basis that at the next occasion we do expect the solicitor with overall responsibility for the conduct of this case to appear in court in order to deal with the issues to which we have referred.""
To that end Mr Kieran Henry, the Director of Henry's Solicitors, has appeared with Mr Shrimpton of counsel, to whom we are indebted. Mr Henry recognises that the notice of appeal appears to place his firm as the instructing solicitors. He acknowledges that he was in fact in Stockport Magistrates' Court on 12th June and further acknowledges that his firm is aware of Mr O'Connor whom he says is a self-employed outdoor clerk, with no authority to institute proceedings in the name of the firm and with no employed status of any sort.
6.
When it was put to Mr Shrimpton that on two occasions the office of the Registrar had contacted his firm and one occasion speaking to Mr O'Connor and the other speaking to someone who at least the officer of the court understood to be the secretary of Mr O'Connor. Mr Shrimpton repeated his instructions that although Mr O’Connor might have had access to reception at one of the offices, he had no other connection with the firm save that to which we have referred.
7.
The court has also received correspondence which purports to come from Henry's Solicitors in the form of a letter; we were told that the letterhead, which is in the name of the firm and which identifies four sub officers is old stationary and has been replaced by newer stationery. We were alsoo told that Mr O'Connor might well have had access to the old stationery while moving into and out of the office. The letter was a fax and the fax number from which it originates also appears to be a fax number from Henrys.
8.
We deal, first, with the Reference pursuant to
section 20
of the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
, which is to consider whether the grounds of appeal were properly formulated, whether appropriate steps had been taken to investigate the allegations made against prior solicitors and whether the appeal should be struck out
in limine
. Mr Shrimpton, who does not appear for Mr Graham, has made it clear that as far as his instructions from Henry's are concerned they entirely disavow the notice of appeal. Mr Shrimpton readily accepts that it contains no arguable ground of appeal and is properly struck out. Although not acting for Mr Graham, that view reflects our own conclusion: the application for leave to appeal is summarily dismissed.
9.
As regards the remainder, it is a matter of great concern to the court that somebody is able to pass himself off as representing a firm of solicitors and has sufficient access to the firm to be able to use its stationery, albeit old stationery, and at least on the face of it both respond to telephone communication and use the fax.
10.
There are clearly issues of compliance and governance for the solicitors to address but in the meantime we are not in a position to get to the bottom of what has transpired and we refer the papers to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority accordingly.
11.
Mr Shrimpton, we are very grateful to you for your attendance. We are grateful to Mr Henry for coming although we did not give him much of a choice.
12.
MR SHRIMPTON: The issue of costs my Lord.
13.
PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION: Do not even think about it.
14.
MR SHRIMPTON: I will say no more.","citation:

1.
LORD JUSTICE ELIAS: On 30th April 2014 in the Crown Court at Woolwich before His Honour Shorrock, the applicant pleaded guilty to a count of possessing a controlled drug of Class A with intent and he received a sentence of thirteen-and-a-half years' imprisonment on 24th June in relation to that offence. On 14th May a separate count was added to the indictment, possession of a false identity document, and he also pleaded guilty to that offence and was given 6 months' imprisonment consecutive. So the total sentence in his case was 14 years. A co-accused, Henry Duksavius, pleaded guilty to possessing a controlled drug of Class A and he was sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment. The appellant now seeks an extension of time in which to renew his application for leave to appeal against sentence following a refusal by the single judge and of course he seeks leave to appeal.
2.
Given the nature of the grounds, the facts can be stated very summarily. They involve, as we have said, a significant drug operation, involving drugs of street value of around £4.5 million.
3.
There is nothing wrong with the sentence as such, as counsel concedes. He has really a single point in this appeal and it concerns the different way in which the judge dealt with the credit he was going to give for the pleas. In the case of Duksavius the judge gave credit of 33% and in the case of the applicant it was 25%. Counsel submits that in the circumstances there was no material difference between the two defendants. Each had not pleaded at the preliminary hearing and had pleaded later. It is true, as he concedes, that the plea and case management hearing of the co-defendant was earlier in time but that was because of difficulties facing counsel, it was for no good reason and essentially the judge was not entitled to draw the distinction that he did.
4.
The first point to note is that there can be no complaint at all it seems to us about a reduction limited to 25% for this applicant in all the circumstances of the case. He did not plead at the earliest opportunity and in the usual way cannot expect to have full credit for his plea.
5.
The judge specifically addressed the question whether the credit given to the two co-defendants should be the same and he concluded that they should not. He said in terms:
""...I am not impressed by the fact that apparently reasons are connected with your representation rather than anything else. Had you shown that you were truly remorseful of this for the word go, you in your possession could have indicated that at a much earlier stage.""
6.
It is always difficult to argue disparity before the courts, particularly when a judge has dealt with a matter and addressed it directly. He was of course was in a much better place than we are to assess what credit should be given and he came to the view that he did. In addition, it has to be said that the circumstances of the co-defendant were quite different for other reasons which also have to be taken into account when looking at the sentences overall. He was given credit for other considerations which do not weigh in this case.
7.
Although the matter has been put very attractively by counsel, who has made the points succinctly, nonetheless we are not persuaded that we should grant leave in this case. There was nothing wrong with the credit given to this applicant and therefore we refuse leave.","citation:

THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
I shall ask Mr Justice Holroyde to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE HOLROYDE:
1. These appellants, Alexandris Kudriasov and Andris Apsitis, were convicted after a lengthy trial in the Crown Court at Lincoln of two offences of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, contrary to
section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861
, and an offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice. On 17
th
May 2016 the trial judge, His Honour Judge Hirst, sentenced each of them to a total of 18 years' imprisonment, comprising concurrent terms of 18 years' imprisonment for each of the
section 18
offences and two years' imprisonment for the conspiracy offence.
2. The appellants now appeal against the length of their sentences by leave of the single judge.
3. The offences were committed in Boston, Lincolnshire, on a Saturday evening in September 2015. The appellants and others drove to a block of flats which was the home of the victims of the offences of violence, Mr Kaleckas and Mr Likso. The group were armed and clearly intent on violence. Apsitis was carrying a knife. One of the group was carrying an extendable baton, and others had clubs. Kudriasov may have been carrying a golf club, though it is submitted on his behalf that the evidence pointed to his having acquired that weapon at the scene.
4. Mr Kaleckas and Mr Likso were smoking on a landing outside their flat when they saw the appellants and others coming up the stairs. They were immediately struck to the head and body. Both stumbled to the ground as they tried to escape to their flat. Mr Likso managed to get into the flat and picked up a golf club to defend himself. He was pursued into a bedroom, but used pieces of a dismantled bed to drive his attackers back as they continued to strike at him with clubs and the baton. Outside the flat he tried to help his friend Mr Kaleckas, who was on the ground being punched and stabbed by the appellant Apsitis and another man. The evidence showed that Apsitis stabbed Mr Kaleckas about eleven times to his front and back torso. Mr Likso was then driven back into his bedroom, where the appellant Kudriasov struck him on the head with a golf club. The blow was so violent that the head of the golf club broke off the shaft. Kudriasov then stabbed the shaft into Mr Likso's chest. Mr Likso was aware of another attacker holding a knife to his face, but then lost consciousness.
5. The appellants left the scene by car. They endeavoured to clean their clothing and footwear and the car. They were assisted in this by a third defendant who was also convicted of the conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice.
6. As a result of the attack, Mr Likso sustained a fractured skull, a large cut to the back of his head, and stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. He underwent surgery to repair a damaged part of his bowel. He spent a number of days in intensive care, and he underwent a further operation shortly before the trial. By the time of the trial he was still unable to lift heavy weights. His digestive system was impaired. He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and was unable to work.
7. Mr Kaleckas suffered wounds to the side of his head, multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen, and stab wounds to his right hand and left elbow. As a result of his injuries, he has lost control over some of the fingers of one hand. He bears the scars of his wounds. He, too, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. He has nightmares, and he too is unable to work. Thus, both victims suffer significant continuing disability.
8. The appellant Apsitis is now 37 years old. He has previously been convicted of offences which were not particularly serious and did not involve violence. The learned judge rightly treated him as being of effective good character.
9. The appellant Kudriasov is now 43 years old. He was of previous good character.
10. In his sentencing remarks the learned judge observed, with justification, that the injuries, serious as they were, could have been far worse. He concluded that the case fell within category 1 of the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline in relation to assault cases. The factors which the judge found indicated greater harm were that the assaults on both victims were sustained, and, at least in the case of Mr Likso, that the injury which was caused was serious in the context of the offence. The factors which he identified as indicating higher culpability were the significant degree of premeditation and the use of weapons.
11. Mr Watson and Miss Leonard, for whose succinct and focused submissions we are grateful, realistically accept that the
section 18
offences fell within category 1. That gives a starting point for each of those offences of twelve years' imprisonment, with a sentence range from nine to 16 years.
12. In addition, the judge rightly identified a number of aggravating features: first, the fact that the attacks took place in the victims’ home; secondly, the significant ongoing effect on both victims, and the fact that they had felt obliged not only to leave their homes, but also to leave this country; thirdly, the fear caused to persons who were present and witnessed the assault – one witness suffered a significant psychological effect and has lost her career; another felt obliged to leave the Boston area and so became separated from her family; fourthly, the fact that the aftermath of the incident was also witnessed by young children; and finally, the fact that the offences were committed under the influence of alcohol.
13. The judge treated the attempts made to clean the clothing and the car as an aggravating feature of the
section 18
offences, and so dealt with the conspiracy count by a concurrent sentence.
14. Neither counsel suggests that the judge was wrong to treat both appellants in the same way, or to structure the sentences in the way he did. It is, however, submitted on behalf of both appellants that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to a number of important matters of mitigation. So far as the offences are concerned, it is submitted that the judge should have given greater weight to the role played by the appellants. Counsel tell us, and we of course accept from them, that in the course of the sentencing hearing the judge had indicated that neither of the appellants was the leading member of the group of attackers and that they had been brought into the incident by another or others who had not been convicted. We understand that the judge took the view that it was someone other than the two appellants who, to adopt counsel's helpful phrase, ""led the charge"". No specific observation or finding to that effect was made in the sentencing remarks.
15. It is further argued that the judge was wrong to reject a submission that there had been an element of provocation, which provided some mitigation for the offences of violence. In this regard, counsel pointed to evidence that there had been an incident earlier that day in which Kudriasov had been injured. They argued, in the alternative, in their respective written grounds, that the judge should have found some mitigation in evidence suggesting that there may have been some kind of drugs background to the attack on Messrs Kaleckas and Likso.
16. Turning to personal mitigation, both appellants submit that the judge, although he specifically referred in his sentencing remarks to the appellants' previous good character, or effective good character, failed to give sufficient weight to that aspect of the case. Counsel pray in aid that both appellants are hard-working men with family responsibilities, and that both have behaved well and made good use of their time in custody whilst on remand awaiting trial.
17. Next, specific submissions are made on behalf of the appellant Apsitis to the effect that his inability to speak or read English will mean that time in custody will be harder for him than for most other prisoners. It is also submitted on his behalf that the judge should have given some weight to the fact that Apsitis had always admitted presence, and that at a plea and case management hearing he had admitted guilt of an offence of unlawful wounding.
18. On behalf of the appellant Kudriasov, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that he may well have brought a golf club to the scene. It is, however, realistically acknowledged that, whether he did or not, he was part of a group who were collectively armed.
19. For those various reasons counsel submit that the total sentences of 18 years' imprisonment were manifestly excessive in length.
20. We accept that each of those points is well-founded, but we have to consider the weight which can be given to them. It seems to us that, whether or not the appellants were the leading members of the group, there can be no doubt that they played leading roles in the joint violence which caused such serious injury to the two victims.
21. As to the suggested provocation or background to the violence, the judge specifically addressed this in his sentencing remarks. He said that he did not know what had been the cause of the attack. He noted that one appellant had not given evidence, and the other had given a lying account about a drugs purchase which went wrong. He said that each of the appellants had had the opportunity to say what the true cause of the incident was, but had chosen not to do so. In those circumstances we can well understand the learned judge's conclusion. We would observe that it is, in any event, difficult to see how either a suggested drugs-related background or a wish to seek revenge for an earlier incident could provide mitigation.
22. As to the matters of personal mitigation, we are confident that the learned judge must have taken these into account when he passed sentence.
23. We must then step back and consider the overall submission, which can be summarised in this way. The sentencing guideline for a single offence of this nature indicates a starting point of twelve years and a range which goes up to 16 years. Counsel argue, cogently, that even taking into the fact that there were two offences of serious violence, an increase from the starting point of twelve years to a sentence of 18 years was manifestly excessive. Counsel invite the court to consider what sentence would have been passed if the offender whom the judge did regard as having led the charge had been convicted.
24. We see merit in those submissions. We are persuaded that the learned judge did on this occasion move too far upwards from the guideline starting point. In our judgment, for the offences of wounding with intent, concurrent sentences of 16 years' imprisonment would have sufficed to reflect the undoubted gravity of the offending.
25. In those circumstances, we allow each of the appeals to this extent. We quash the concurrent sentences of 18 years' imprisonment, and we substitute for them concurrent sentences of 16 years' imprisonment.
26. We make no alteration to the concurrent term for the offence of conspiring to pervert the course of public justice.
27. Thus, the effect of our decision is that for each of these appellants the total term of imprisonment is reduced from 18 years to 16 years.","citation:

    Comment: trial judge did not consider mitigating factors correctly
    Exact: 15. It is further argued that the judge was wrong to reject a submission that there had been an element of provocation, which provided some mitigation for the offences of violence. In this regard, counsel pointed to evidence that there had been an incident earlier that day in which Kudriasov had been injured. They argued, in the alternative, in their respective written grounds, that the judge should have found some mitigation in evidence suggesting that there may have been some kind of drugs background to the attack on Messrs Kaleckas and Likso.16. Turning to personal mitigation, both appellants submit that the judge, although he specifically referred in his sentencing remarks to the appellants' previous good character, or effective good character, failed to give sufficient weight to that aspect of the case. Counsel pray in aid that both appellants are hard-working men with family responsibilities, and that both have behaved well and made good use of their time in custody whilst on remand awaiting trial.17. Next, specific submissions are made on behalf of the appellant Apsitis to the effect that his inability to speak or read English will mean that time in custody will be harder for him than for most other prisoners. It is also submitted on his behalf that the judge should have given some weight to the fact that Apsitis had always admitted presence, and that at a plea and case management hearing he had admitted guilt of an offence of unlawful wounding.18. On behalf of the appellant Kudriasov, it is submitted that the judge was wrong to find that he may well have brought a golf club to the scene. It is, however, realistically acknowledged that, whether he did or not, he was part of a group who were collectively armed.19. For those various reasons counsel submit that the total sentences of 18 years' imprisonment were manifestly excessive in length.

THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE:
1. This is an application by Her Majesty's Attorney General under
section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988
for leave to refer to this court a sentence which he considers to be unduly lenient. We grant leave.
2. The offender is Mitchell Moir. He is aged 21, having been born on 17 December 1989. He is of good character.
3. On 10 November 2010, at Exeter Crown Court, before Mr Justice Jack and a jury, he was convicted of rape. He was sentenced to three and a half years' detention in a young offender institution. On 12 November 2010, exercising his powers under
section 155 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000
, the judge reduced the sentence to two years' detention.
4. In summary, the victim was a young woman with whom the offender had had a sexual relationship in the course of which she became pregnant by him. She had a termination of pregnancy two weeks before the offence was committed. She gave evidence at trial that before that date she had made clear to the offender that as far as she was concerned, although they were still friendly, they were no longer in a sexual relationship. The offender's evidence at trial was that he did not know for sure where he stood. On 6 September 2009 he was staying the night at the victim's house. He asked her whether he could sleep with her. She told him that he should sleep downstairs on the sofa. She then went up to her own bed and fell asleep. While she was asleep the offender went into her bedroom. She was wearing knickers and nothing else. He removed his own clothes and he raped her while she was asleep. She did not wake up; but the following morning she realised that somehow she had had sexual intercourse while she was asleep because her genital area felt sore and she found semen in her vagina.
5. In a little more detail the facts were these. The offender had been separated from his family because of family troubles. They had resolved themselves. The victim was not ready for a permanent commitment but the offender was apparently in love with her. A sexual relationship began between them. At one stage she told him that she was falling in love with him. In early August she discovered that she was pregnant. Initially she wanted to keep the child, and she told the offender that she did. But then she decided to have a termination of pregnancy. She underwent the operation two weeks after she discovered that she was pregnant (and two weeks before she was raped).
6. On the night of the offence, the offender was staying at the victim's house babysitting for her child while she went out for the evening. On her return he asked if he was coming up with her. She said, ""No, you know the rules"". She went to the bathroom to undress. He went into her room and she found him under the duvet on the floor. She told him to leave. She told him, too, that she would never sleep with him again. There was then a long discussion in the course of which the offender became tearful and he went downstairs apparently to spend the night there.
7. The victim went to sleep in the early hours of the morning. At about 6.10am she was woken by the child in the bedroom next to hers. She called out to the offender to see to the child. She fell asleep again. She woke up at about 9.45am. She felt sore. She found the offender was in her room and she told him, ""God, I'm really sore"", to which he responded, ""Why would that happen?"" By then he knew that he had had sexual intercourse with her while she was asleep. She went to the lavatory. She then knew what had happened because she found semen on the lavatory paper.
8. It is worth reciting at this stage how the trial judge believed that the incident had unfolded. In his sentencing remarks on 10 November he said this:
""In the morning, while she asleep, you went into her bedroom to get some clean clothes; you had clothes in a drawer in her bedroom. She was lying on the bed asleep, uncovered, wearing only her knickers. You took advantage of the situation to have sex with her. She did not wake. How long it lasted I do not know, but it was enough to make her sore, and your semen was found on swabs taken from her.""
In the judge's view it was something on which the offender had decided on the spur of the moment. The only two further facts to be added are that the act of intercourse took place without the offender using any form of contraception and that he had ejaculated.
9. The victim contacted her mother, who called the police. She sent a series of text messages to the offender asserting that he had had sexual intercourse with her. To begin with he denied it. He then sent a text to the effect that, as a joke, he had ""poked"" her in the vagina to see if she would wake up. He later texted:
""I'll be honest, I didn't have sex with you but I did go to wake you. Then it was like no, we are not fuck buddies any more. I penetrated for a second and I'm really sorry. I'm panicking like shit. Please don't get me arrested. I won't even talk to you again if you want that.""
10. The victim said to the police, and she made it clear throughout -- and it seems to have been the position she maintained from start to finish -- that her complaint was not of being upset; she was angry. She said that she had trusted the offender with her son and she had trusted him in her house.
11. The offender was arrested and interviewed under caution. He denied rape. He asserted that he had penetrated the victim with his penis unintentionally. He said that he had gone upstairs in response to her request that he look in on her son and then wake her up later at nine o'clock. He went to the bathroom to freshen up. He said that he had entered her bedroom in order both to wake her up and to change his underpants after washing because he had clothes in the drawer in the bedroom. He then said, ""Um, 'cos of the intimate relationship we had before as, just for a laugh, I went to, um, I went to try and wake her up by having sex with her, but I didn't actually do it"". He said that he had moved her knickers to one side as she lay on her back in bed and positioned his body above hers and then, with his penis very close to her vagina, he decided not to penetrate after all, but at the same time, in her sleep, she had pulled him towards her and that as a result his penis had penetrated her vagina. He said that he was unclear about how long penetration had lasted. At one point he said that he had penetrated her for less than thirty seconds before he ""just like sort of stopped and tried to wake her up again"". At another point he said that penetration had lasted less than a couple of seconds because he had moved immediately backwards so as to stop. He agreed that he had not used a condom. Initially, he denied ejaculation and later said that if semen were to be found inside her vagina, that would be because he sometimes ejaculated prematurely and he could not be sure whether that had happened on this occasion.
12. It is recorded that on 6 and 15 September 2009 he wrote letters of apology to the victim. However, an examination of the evidence shows that he also subsequently wrote one or two unpleasant messages to her on a Facebook print-out.
13. The case proceeded as a trial. It is difficult to see what possible defence there might have been. In truth, as the judge said, the defence advanced was nonsense. Still, that was the offender's decision. He chose not to plead guilty. The jury considered the evidence and decided that the case was proved.
14. There was no pre-sentence report, although a letter from the offender's stepfather was placed before the judge. It contained a number of matters of mitigation and the judge referred to it and considered it.
15. In his sentencing remarks on this aspect of the case, the judge first of all dealt with the facts of the offence. He addressed the suggestion that the offender intended to have sexual intercourse with the victim only if she were agreeable to it. As we have earlier recorded, he said that the suggestion of accidental penetration was nonsense and that it was most unfortunate that the offender could not bring himself to accept the advice that he had been given. In addressing the facts, the judge said that the act was entirely wrong but he doubted that it could properly be described as malevolent. He then went on to say that some mitigation was provided by the fact that the victim was asleep and unaware of what was happening to her, and that it was only when she woke up that she realised what must have occurred. He then described that she had been shocked and angry at what she had found and noted that her distress was very much less than it often is in these cases. That view was confirmed by the demeanour exhibited by the victim during the video which was made to record her evidence the following morning, when she indeed made it plain that she was more angry than upset.
16. The judge went on to identify some of the immediate consequences of the arrest. He believed that the offender had been very severely affected by the case. Twice since his arrest he had tried to take his own life. The judge therefore concluded, the offender now being back at home living with his mother and his stepfather and in permanent employment, that he should pass a sentence at the lower end of the scale. He considered the definitive guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines Council on Sexual Offences and he passed the sentence of three and a half years' detention in a young offender institution.
17. Two days later the case was listed again. The judge said that he had originally described the circumstances of the offence as ""unusual"". He went on to say that he could have said that they were ""very unusual"". He made it clear that he did not question the verdict of the jury. On the evidence before them ""a guilty verdict was the only verdict open to them if they were to be true to their oath"". He reminded himself of the guideline that the sentence of three and a half years' detention was already ""below the suggested range"". He then returned to address the fact, amply established, that none of the guidelines constitute straitjackets and that judges should have the courage to depart from guidelines where it was right to do so. Addressing the facts of the case he said:
""The medical evidence shows that there was penetration, that there was ejaculation; but as I have thought about the case, the more incredible it seems to me to be that there could have been anything beginning to approach a normal act of intercourse on your part without her waking. By 'normal' I do not of course include 'consensual'. Whatever happened must have been very brief.""
18. The judge then examined the guideline which suggests the approach to be taken by sentencing judges where there has been penetration other than by the penis. Having reflected on these matters and considered the offender's culpability he came to the conclusion that no real harm was caused and therefore, in accordance with
section 143
and
153(2)
of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
, the shortest sentence possible must be passed and the sentence would therefore be one of two years' detention.
19. Much of the reasoning identified in the sentencing remarks, and the further sentencing remarks, is criticised on behalf of the Attorney General. But in the end the real difficulty with the way in which the judge made the observations that he did can be simply expressed: the offender raped the victim. She was not aware of the rape and she was therefore not frightened or fearful; she did not seek to fight off the rapist. The penetration cannot have lasted for a very long time, although it was sufficient in whatever form it took, to have made her sore. But the fact that she was asleep does not constitute mitigation any more than it would have been mitigation if she had been unconscious through drink.
20. There is no scope for much jurisprudence on this issue. It is true that the victim will not remember the precise circumstances of what is always a ghastly experience. But, on the other hand, she was the victim, and she knew perfectly well that she had been the victim of a gross breach of trust. It made her angry. She was fully entitled to be angry at what had happened.
21. In the end a sentencing judge must reflect what actually happened and the circumstances in which the offence of rape took place. In this case the rape occurred just two weeks after the victim's pregnancy by the offender had been terminated; she had made it clear to him, quite unequivocally, that she did not want to have a sexual relationship with him; and in the course of the incident of rape he put her at risk of another pregnancy when she did not want to become pregnant, and certainly did not want to be pregnant by him.
22. We are unpersuaded that any mitigation arises from the fact that the victim was asleep. We are equally unpersuaded that there was any mitigation arising from the fact that her reaction was anger rather than distress. Nor are we able to accept that no harm was caused by this act of rape. The circumstances certainly were unusual. We accept and acknowledge it.
23. However, having reflected on the fact that the circumstances were unusual, in a case which proceeded as a trial during the course of which the victim had to give evidence about what she remembered, with no guilty plea a sentence of three and a half years' detention might very well have been regarded as unduly lenient. A sentence of two years undoubtedly was.
24. The appropriate sentence in this case is a sentence of five years' imprisonment, as it will be, the offender now being 21 years old. We therefore substitute for the sentence of two years' detention in a young offender institution, a sentence of five years' imprisonment.

    Comment: Sentencing judge did not refer to relevant sentencing guidelines
    Exact: . He reminded himself of the guideline that the sentence of three and a half years' detention was already ""below the suggested range"". He then returned to address the fact, amply established, that none of the guidelines constitute straitjackets and that judges should have the courage to depart from guidelines where it was right to do so. Addressing the facts of the case he said:
 
  
  
 ""The medical evidence shows that there was penetration, that there was ejaculation; but as I have thought about the case, the more incredible it seems to me to be that there could have been anything beginning to approach a normal act of intercourse on your part without her waking. By 'normal' I do not of course include 'consensual'. Whatever happened must have been very brief.""
 
 18. The judge then examined the guideline which suggests the approach to be taken by sentencing judges where there has been penetration other than by the penis. Having reflected on these matters and considered the offender's culpability he came to the conclusion that no real harm was caused and therefore, in accordance with section 143 and 153(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the shortest sentence possible must be passed and the sentence would therefore be one of two years' detention.

MISS J BICKERSTAFF KC and MISS T SHROFF
appeared on behalf of the Applicant
_________
J U D G M E N T
(Approved)
1.
THE VICE-PRESIDENT:  This applicant and her former partner, Jake Drummond stood trial at the Central Criminal Court on charges arising out of the death of the applicant's 15-month-old son, Jacob.  The applicant gave evidence.  She then pleaded guilty to an offence of cruelty to a person under 16 years (count 4).  She was convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child (count 3).  She was subsequently sentenced by the trial judge, Sweeting J, to 10 years' imprisonment for that offence, with a concurrent sentence of six years on count 4.  Drummond was convicted of murder and wounding with intent.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 32 years, less the days he had spent remanded in custody.
2.
The applicant applied for leave to appeal against her sentence.  That application was refused by the single judge.  It is now renewed to the full court.
3.
The facts have been fully set out by the Criminal Appeal Office in a document available to the applicant, and for present purposes the following very brief summary is sufficient.
4.
The applicant was aged 29 at the time of Jacob's death.  She had no previous convictions.  She had suffered domestic abuse at the hands of more than one former partner.  She was the mother of two sons, the older of whom was then aged four.  The boys had different fathers, neither of whom appears to have been actively involved in their care.
5.
In late 2019 she began a relationship with Drummond, whom she had known for many years.  Over a period of weeks Drummond repeatedly inflicted serious violence on Jacob, causing injuries which the applicant knew about but did not prevent or report.
6.
On 27 August 2019 she made a 999 call requesting an ambulance.  She reported that Jacob had not been breathing for some minutes.  Jacob was taken to hospital but had plainly suffered serious head injuries and was pronounced dead a short time later.  In the 999 call and subsequently, the applicant and Drummond jointly put forward a false explanation for Jacob's injuries.  The cause of death was severe head injury in the context of two previous occasions of head injury.  Observations when Jacob was first seen, and subsequent investigations, showed that he had suffered more than one impact-related and/or shaking injury to his brain.  Some were several days or weeks old.  That which had caused his death rendered him unconscious some hours before the ambulance was called.  Consistent with those injuries, there were some 20 external injuries to Jacob's head and face.  When admitted to hospital he was severely bruised in both eyes and his eyes were so swollen that they could not be opened.  There was bruising to other areas of the head and face, some indicative of blows being struck.  The entire skull was very swollen and of sponge-like consistency.
7.
Jacob's limbs and body had also been repeatedly injured.  There was a 3cm laceration of his penis, possibly caused by forceful pinching or a bite, which had penetrated through the full thickness of the skin.  There was an injury to his scrotum which had been inflicted with a sharp implement.
8.
The judge summarised what Drummond had done to a young and vulnerable child by saying that Drummond's conduct involved:
""... a course of conduct of a deliberate, cruel and sadistic nature.  There was a pattern of behaviour.  The penile and scrotal injuries can only be explained as sadistic in nature.  They must have been excruciatingly painful.  The other injuries show a deliberate course of conduct involving gratuitous violence.""
9.
There was clear evidence that the applicant knew the injuries which Jacob had suffered and the judge in sentencing rejected the suggestion that she had been subject to any degree of coercive control by Drummond.
10.
In text messages passing between her and Drummond, Drummond referred to Jacob's bedroom as ""the torture chamber"" and the applicant described Jacob as ""looking like a little madman"" because of his bruises.  The applicant nonetheless tried to cover up what had happened by putting forward false accounts of accidental injury and claims of an improvement in Jacob's condition.  She lied to a close friend who saw Jacob at a time when the applicant herself described his head as ""looking like a basketball"".  She lied to another friend to whom she sent a photo showing Jacob's bruised face.  A few days before the fatal incident she lied to a social worker in order to avoid a planned visit at which the severe bruising to Jacob's head and face would have been observed.  All those lies contributed to the continuing violence towards Jacob escaping detection by the authorities until after his death.
11.
The judge was assisted by a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report.  He accepted from the pre-sentence report that the applicant now recognised the extent of her guilt and was genuinely remorseful, and that she had suffered a difficult life.  He took into account that the applicant's older son had been removed from her and adopted.  He accepted from the psychiatric report that the applicant may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder at the material time.  He did not consider that that condition impaired her ability to make rational choices, but did take it into account in considering the effect of the sentence upon her.
12.
The judge considered the Sentencing Council's relevant definitive sentencing guidelines.  He placed the count 3 offence in category B1 of the guideline which gave a starting point of nine years' custody and a range from seven to 14 years.  He found that the offence was aggravated by the prolonged suffering which Jacob endured prior to his death and by the applicant's attempts to cover up or conceal the offending.  The count 4 offence also came within category B1 of its relevant guideline, with a starting point of six years' custody and a range from four to eight years.  In those circumstances, he imposed the sentences to which we have referred.
13.
We have been assisted by written and oral submissions by Miss Bickerstaff KC and Miss Shroff who appear before us today, having represented the applicant at her trial.  Miss Bickerstaff puts forward an over-arching submission that the total sentence is manifestly excessive.  She advances a number of arguments.  She no longer pursues an initial written submission that the principal offence should have been placed into category C1; rather, she accepts that the judge was entitled to place it into category B1, but submits that having done so, the judge should have made an initial downward adjustment from the starting point for that category.  He should have done so, she submits, in particular having regard to these features of the offending: that the applicant's involvement was limited to a period of 12 days; that there was no suggestion that she had personally inflicted or witnessed the inflicting of any of the injuries; that she had made some efforts to assist Jacob; and that the visible injuries to him did not alert her to the very serious underlying brain injuries which Jacob was suffering.
14.
Miss Bickerstaff goes on to submit that if the judge was correct to treat it as a category B1 offence, he then fell into the error of double counting by treating Jacob's prolonged suffering as an aggravating feature.  That is because one of the category B high culpability factors which the judge found to be applicable to the case is ""prolonged and/or multiple incidents of serious cruelty including serious neglect.""
15.
Next, Miss Bickerstaff submits that the only aggravating factor which should have been taken into account was the attempted cover-up but that, she argues, was balanced by the absence of previous convictions and the applicant's remorse.  Furthermore, she argues, although the judge was correct to follow the guideline he did, he should have made an allowance for the fact that the offence was committed at the time when the statutory maximum penalty for it was one of 14 years' imprisonment, whereas the guideline had come into effect following an increase by Parliament to a maximum of life imprisonment.
16.
Finally, Miss Bickerstaff argues that the judge must have given insufficient weight to the personal mitigation and to the mental health position revealed by the psychiatric report in reaching what was, on any view, a severe sentence.
17.
We are very grateful to counsel for their submissions, the more so because they have been good enough to act
pro bono
in preparing and presenting this renewed application.  We are not however persuaded by the submissions.
18.
We consider first the point made to the effect that the count 3 offence was committed before the statutory maximum penalty for such offences was increased but the relevant guideline came into effect after that increase.  That fact cannot assist the applicant.  As the single judge, Hilliard J, observed, the appropriate application of the guideline in circumstances such as these was stated by this court in
R v AZT
[2023] EWCA Crim 1277, in particular at paragraph 3.  The judge here was obliged to give effect to the guideline, save that he could not impose a sentence which was longer than the statutory maximum in force at the time of the crime.
19.
Next, we observe that the guideline specifically applies both to offences involving the causing of death and to offences of allowing the death of a child.  The facts and circumstances of individual cases of course differ, but the guideline does not assume or presuppose that an offence of permitting the death will always and necessarily be less serious than an offence of causing the death.
20.
As to the categorisation of this offending under that guideline, the applicant had failed to protect Jacob from offences in which at least three features of high culpability were present: multiple incidents of serious cruelty, sadistic behaviour by Drummond, and the use of very significant force by Drummond.  The applicant had also deliberately disregarded her son's welfare.  There can therefore be no successful criticism of the judge's decision to place the offence in category B1.  With respect to the judge we accept Miss Bickerstaff's submission that there was an element of double counting in treating as an aggravating factor the prolonged suffering which was the inevitable result of the multiple incidents of serious cruelty.  As against that, however, the presence of at least three high culpability factors would of itself have justified an upwards movement from the category B1 starting point.  The judge would moreover have been entitled to treat as a further serious aggravating factor the impact of the offending on the applicant's older son, who has suffered the death of his younger brother.
21.
We have given careful thought to Miss Bickerstaff's submissions as to the weight properly to be given to the applicant's personal mitigation and mental health issues.  We are not persuaded that there is any basis on which it can be argued that the judge failed to accord sufficient weight to these factors.  It is important to note that the judge conducted the trial and had heard the applicant give her evidence.  He was entitled to conclude that her PTSD did not materially reduce her culpability.  He made plain that he took account of her mental health in terms of the impact on her of serving a custodial sentence.  In our view, the judge plainly did take into account the personal mitigation.  The sad reality however is, as the judge said, that the applicant had prioritised her relationship with Drummond over concern for her child.
22.
For those reasons, we reach the same conclusion as did the single judge.  There is no arguable basis on which it can be said that the total sentence was manifestly excessive.  Grateful though we are to Miss Bickerstaff, whose submissions have been as well made as they possibly could have been, this renewed application therefore fails and must be refused.

J U D G M E N T
Thursday, 22nd July 2004
1.
LORD JUSTICE ROSE: On 24th February 2004, at Blackfriars Crown Court, these applicants pleaded guilty on re-arraignment and the following day they were sentenced by His Honour Judge Hitching, in the case of Toomey to eight years' imprisonment for robbery and in the case of Francis to seven years' imprisonment for robbery. Counts of false imprisonment and theft were left on the file on the usual terms. They now renew their applications for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge.
2.
The victim of their activity was a 30 year old man who lived alone on the top seventh floor of a tower block in Plumstead. He was a homosexual. He sought to maintain the privacy of his private life.
3.
Soon after he moved into that flat he met the applicant Toomey, who visited him and asked him for money. On a number of occasions the victim of this offence, as he became, handed over money to Toomey, usually in the sum of £20.
4.
These sort of events came to an end when Toomey was sent to prison in November 2002, but during the spring and summer of the following year the applicant Francis started to visit the complainant and ask for money, which was handed over.
5.
At about 9.30 on the evening of 8th October 2003 the two applicants visited the complainant at his flat, and at Toomey's request the complainant handed over to him £20. At the time the complainant was with a 17 year old youth, as must have been apparent to his unwelcome visitors.
6.
Shortly after 11 o'clock the same evening, while the victim and the youth were watching a film, there was a knock at the door and Toomey was shouting through the door. For a while the victim ignored this, but then there was a loud thud from the roof of the flat. The victim looked out and saw Toomey jumping down onto his rear balcony, brandishing a hammer with which he smashed the lounge window. The complainant ran to his front door, but when he opened it he was confronted by Francis and another man. He was pushed back into the flat and forced to the ground. He cried out for help, a hand was put over his mouth and money was demanded from him. He handed over £40. The men left.
7.
Later that evening the two applicants were arrested. In interview they declined to make any comment.
8.
When he passed sentence, the learned judge referred to the vulnerability, by reason of his sexuality, of the victim of this offence, and he referred to the bullying in the background history to the offence which we have briefly summarised. The judge pointed out that the victim of that bullying was, as was anticipated by those bullying him, reluctant to go to the police, and indeed when they returned on the occasion that the robbery was committed, they did not wear disguises because, as the judge described it, they were quietly confident that their victim would not do anything. They were both, the judge pointed out, big men, well able to overpower their victim.
9.
The picture which, in summary, the judge described was of a vulnerable victim, terrified in his own home by two much larger men. He indicated that he would give credit for the pleas of guilty, but pointed out that they were tendered at a late stage and there was no obvious demonstration of remorse by either of the applicants. Indeed until the very last moment the complainant had been faced with the prospect of giving evidence against them.
10.
The judge noted that Toomey's record was more serious than that of Francis and, furthermore, he was on licence at the time when he committed this offence. Toomey is 29 years of age. He has previous convictions for affray, burglary, attempted burglary, inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and common assault. Francis, who is about ten years older, also has two previous convictions for assault with intent to resist arrest and one for threatening behaviour.
11.
The submission which is made by Mr Cray, on behalf of Toomey, is that the learned judge, in indicating a starting point of nine to ten years following a conviction, chose too high a starting point bearing in mind that this was a single offence, albeit committed against an unusual background. Mr Cray draws attention to
Attorney General's Reference No 48 of 2000
,
R v Johnson
[2001] 1 Cr App R (S) 423
, where, at page 427, following a review of some of the authorities, Roch LJ indicated that in relation to a single offence where an offender had pleaded guilty (and he clearly had in mind where a maximum discount was being given for a plea of guilty), the range appropriate is between four and seven years' imprisonment.
12.
Mr Reid, on behalf of Francis, added to that criticism of the judge's approach a criticism of further observations which he made which seemed to suggest that he believed that he was imposing, in the sentences which he selected, sentences at the lower end of the appropriate bracket, and that, submits Mr Reid, is not right.
13.
The crucial question for this court is whether it is arguable that the sentences imposed on either of these applicants were manifestly excessive. In our judgment, these were severe sentences. But this was an extremely unpleasant offence, committed by two large men with previous convictions for violence against a vulnerable victim in his own home. In our judgment, it is not, even arguably, a manifestly excessive sentence. Accordingly, these renewed applications, despite the succinct and attractive submissions of both counsel, are refused.","citation:

1.
MRS JUSTICE HALLETT: On 19th November 2004 at the Canterbury Crown Court the appellants R, aged 13, and L, aged 12, pleaded guilty to an offence of committing arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. On 10th December 2004 His Honour Van Der Bijl sentenced R to a sentence of 3 years' detention pursuant to
section 91
of the
Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act 2000
. He sentenced L to 2 years' detention pursuant to
section 91
of the Powers of the Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act.
2.
The appellants both appeal against sentence by leave of the Single Judge. They appeared at the Crown Court with a co-accused, BC. He pleaded guilty to one count of arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. He was 15 at the time. He was sentenced to 3 years pursuant to the
Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act 2000
.
3.
The facts are as follows. At about 1.00 am on 2nd August 2004 a Mr Al-Quahed was sitting on a bench in Queens Street, Ramsgate. He was drunk. He recalled being pestered by a group of teenagers asking him for cigarettes. He also recalled smelling burning and he saw that his clothes were on fire. The incident was in fact captured on video by closed circuit television footage. On that footage R can be seen to place a lighter to the back of Mr Al-Quahed. Shortly after that BC took the lighter from R and put the flame to their victim's pocket. This caused the clothing to catch light. At about the same time L put the flame of his lighter to the neck and hood area at the back of their victim. They continued in their efforts to light their victim's clothing until they were satisfied that it had caught a light. When they are satisfied to that effect they then left. Fortunately, another youth who was in the area, older than them, realised what had happened and came over to assist Mr Al-Quahed and helped him put the fire out. When Mr Al-Quahed removed the top that he was wearing it was found to have a 4 inch by 4 inch hole burnt into it. There was also damage to his undershirt.
4.
The appellants and BC were stopped and arrested nearby. BC initially admitted only being near the victim and said he had just seen the flicking of the lighters. Later he had to admit what the video footage showed. L blamed BC. He maintained it was an accident. After he was shown the footage he said he had just been trying to ""singe"" the back of their victim. A transcript of the tape showed that L laughed when he was shown the footage before he was reminded it was a serious matter. After that he described himself as being upset by what he had done.
5.
R denied setting fire to the victim. He said: ""I only did it for a bit but it never caught fire."" He thought he may have been the first one to attempt to light Mr Al-Quahed. He said he did not think he had tried to put him out as he was not near him at the time. He was shown CCTV footage. He said he could not say what had made him do it.
6.
As far as the background of the two young men is concerned, R has a number of previous convictions, six appearances for 10 offences. These include four offences of burglary of dwellings, one of theft from a dwelling, three of detaining a child without lawful authority, one of theft and one of common assault. He has been made subject to an interim care order and a welfare secure accommodation order. He has also been subject to (on our calculations) five supervision orders. At the time that they appeared before the learned judge R was living at accommodation known as Orchard Lodge which is secure accommodation.
7.
L has no previous convictions but one caution for common assault.
8.
A psychiatric report upon R referred to a high risk of serious criminal behaviour from him. The psychiatrist said that he needs ""good parental care, involving parental boundaries and encouragement and rewards for positive behaviour"". He shows signs of a ""number of underlining emotional factors which would have contributed to his previous offending behaviour and these would include parenting difficulties"". The psychiatrist said it was imperative that R was made the subject of a full care order as soon as possible.
9.
A pre-sentence report upon him indicated that this was yet another example of a pattern of behaviour where apparently he incites his peers to act in an antisocial and dangerous way. The welfare secure accommodation order was made because he posed a danger to himself and to others. He was described as a difficult child and one who appeared to have developed what were called ""avoidance strategies"". Addressing his problems was going to be a slow process. He was summarised as a complex young child, with behavioural and social problems of very real concern. He had experienced a difficult family life and it was not surprising, therefore, that he found responding to adults very difficult. The author of the report referred to his record and the escalation in his offending. Whilst in the community, he would, it was thought, continue to offend and posed a high risk to the public. A custodial sentence, it was said, would provide protection of the public and provide him with a clear message that his offending was not acceptable.
10.
As far as L was concerned, a pre-sentence report upon him suggested that, on the basis of his emotional development and his age, he was less culpable than the others who were more criminally entrenched. He is a emotionally vulnerable young boy who functions below his chronological age. At the time of the commission of the offence he had gone missing and was under the influence of cannabis and alcohol. He was described as posing a medium risk of re-offending. The author of the report recommended a supervision order with a package of measures designed to assist L with his problems.
11.
On R's behalf, Mr Jeremy ably argued that the sentence of 3 years, on a plea of guilty, was too long for a child aged 12. He submitted that any 12 year old, let alone this particular 12 year old, would not have appreciated the possibly grave consequences of their action. He certainly would not have appreciated the effect to the extent that an adult would. Mr Jeremy referred us to the reports upon R, indicating what a troubled young man he is and how he has been going through a very troubled phase in his life. He argued that this act (in setting fire to Mr Al-Quahed) was an act of what he called a mischief rather than malice. It was, he said, a spontaneous act, not persisted in, which fortunately caused no serious ill-effects to the victim. He reminded the court, if we needed reminding, that for a child of 12, a year is a very long time. Indeed, this appellant, R, has been in custody in any event for some time. He has been at Orchard Lodge since 4th August 2004. He was sent there by the Southwark Youth Court. A supervision order imposed on 15th September 2004 ended that period of remand. R will not therefore receive any credit for his time in detention for that period.
12.
Mr Jeremy argued that if one looked at the sentence imposed upon R by the learned judge, it must have meant a starting point of something in the region of 6, 7 or 8 years for an adult. That he submitted would be too high a starting point.
13.
Miss Robinson, on behalf of L, argued persuasively to similar effect. She submitted, however, in the case of L that a sentence of detention was wrong in principle. She submitted that the learned judge should have followed the course recommended by the author of the pre-sentence report. She argued that, if a sentence of detention was appropriate, despite her submissions, then the sentence of 2 years was excessive. This was a very young boy. Insufficient account, she argued, was taken of his guilty plea and admissions in interview and the fact that he was of previous good character. She reminded us of his difficult background. It seems that the social services already have a full care order upon this young man or have had and he has been placed on various child protection registers over the years. He too has faced very real family problems.
14.
She submitted, as Mr Jeremy had submitted, that this was an act of stupidity rather than an act of malice. She reminded the Court that L's actions did not actually cause Mr Al-Quahed's coat to be set alight. She invited us to return to the proposal of the social services, for a supervision order. She was not, however, able to put before us any material to indicate that the social services themselves were still arguing for such a course. She did inform us they knew of this appeal today and they knew the effect of her submissions that she would be arguing for a non-custodial penalty.
15.
In our judgment, this is a very disturbing case. It is a rare case. Three young boys, for no apparent reason, set fire to a man. Each played their part. The CCTV footage shows that he was plainly drunk and incapable. All three of the accused played their part in what was, we are satisfied, a determined effort to set Mr Al-Quahed's clothing alight. They did not stop when the first or second attempts failed, they kept going until they thought they had succeeded. Had it not been for the intervention of an older boy, who had the sense and the courage to help put the fire out, the consequences could have been horrific. These two appellants would have faced a very much graver charge and the consequences thereof. Having seen their behaviour on the footage, we are also satisfied that whatever their problems and difficulties, and whatever their ages, they knew what they were doing and they knew how wrong it was. They left the scene laughing.
16.
The reports upon both boys especially also make very troubling reading. R is in particular need of intensive supervision treatment and guidance. L too has had his problems, to which we are referred, albeit that they are not as bad as those that R has experienced and L, of course, does not have a record of previous convictions, just the one caution. R's record is astonishing for a young man of such an age.
17.
The reports upon R indicate that his period of detention at Orchard Lodge has brought home to him, in a way that other sentences have not, the fact that his behaviour is unacceptable. He has benefited, at last, from the structure and the discipline and the continuity provided by secure accommodation. He is making significant progress. This bodes well for the future and reassures this Court to some limited extent.
18.
There has been progress too as far as his education is concerned. He is doing his best, it seems, to address his very real problems. We are satisfied, therefore, that the help he so desperately needs is available to him and we are delighted to see he appears to be taking advantage of it. We note that when he is released he may still in fact be subject to a secure accommodation order. Even if this period of detention were reduced, therefore, it may actually have little or no practical effect upon the arrangements for his care.
19.
As far as L is concerned, according to the reports, he has had virtually no structure to his life to date. He requires constant supervision and is apparently struggling with the rules and boundaries imposed by staff in the secure accommodation where he is now housed. He has to learn, for his own good, that his behaviour has been unacceptable and he must learn that he has to obey society's rules, if he is not to spend his life in detention. We note that at the time of this offence he had been missing for three days - a boy of 11. No one had reported him missing. That same boy of 11 was abusing drugs and alcohol. Plainly L is at most risk when he is at large in the community. His family, sadly, are not in a position to give him the accommodation, discipline and structure he so desperately requires. We are not told that there is in place today any particular placement for him where we could be confident that he would receive that accommodation, discipline and structure. When he is released from detention as far as Miss Robinson is aware, he will either be placed again with foster parents or in a residential home.
20.
This was, therefore, an extremely difficult sentencing exercise and we are not in the slightest bit surprised that the Single Judge decided to refer this matter to the Full Court for us to review. In our judgment, there can be no doubt that for an offence as grave as this, where a direct attempt was made to set fire to a person, a substantial period of detention was inevitable. But for the appellants' ages it could have been significantly longer. Thus, taken in isolation, we are satisfied that the sentences of 3 years' detention and 2 years' detention could not be criticised. Plainly this offence, as grave as it was, merited those sentences.
21.
We turn, therefore, to the question of what is in the best interests of these boys, given their backgrounds, given their needs and given the need to protect society in the long-term. As Mr Jeremy rightly observed, the needs of society go hand in hand with the needs of these boys. We are obliged to put the interests of these two boys at the forefront of our minds and deliberations and we unhesitatingly do so.
22.
The questions for us are whether or not their needs will be best provided for within the detention system and it so whether or not their needs dictate shorter sentences of detention than would otherwise be approved.
23.
Having given all those matters anxious consideration, we are satisfied, beyond any doubt, that what both these young men require is a substantial period of stability. They need the facilities available to them in the placements where they now, in the secure accommodation. They need the discipline. They need the structure. They need the support of people trained to assist them. Therefore, we are satisfied that they are in the best place for them at present. Accordingly we are satisfied that the sentences of 3 years and 2 years are entirely appropriate, on the facts of the case and in the interests and the welfare of these two young boys. Accordingly, the appeals of both young men must be dismissed.","citation:

JUDGMENT
LORD JUSTICE EDIS:
1
This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence in a case where the applicant was convicted of murder, attempted murder and dangerous driving and received a sentence of life imprisonment for murder with a minimum term of 36 years, less 253 days spent on remand.  Other orders were also made which it is unnecessary to set out now.
2
We have, earlier this morning, granted the application for leave to appeal against sentence.  We also grant a representation order which must, we regret, be a representation order for leading counsel alone.  We are very grateful to junior counsel for his attendance and also for the attendance of solicitors representing the appellant who have attended together
pro bono
in order to advance his case.  However, the clear practice of this court in dealing with sentence appeals is to do so by granting representation orders for one single advocate and to allow a representation order for leading counsel is, we think, as far as we can properly go.
3
In
R v Palmer
[2017] EWCA Crim 471
and in the Practice Direction at 39A.7 the desirability of representation on behalf of the prosecution in cases involving fatalities is clearly set out.
4
The prosecution decided, when contacted by the Criminal Appeal Office, that they did not wish to attend the application for leave, although they did wish to attend the hearing of the appeal if leave were granted.  We have attempted to make arrangements today for prosecuting counsel to make submissions, including by CVP if possible; those enquiries have not borne fruit.  It is not possible for the prosecution to be represented by counsel at the appeal if we deal with it today.  We are, therefore, unable to deal with the substantive appeal.
5
The particular reason for this is that the views of the families of the two victims of the offences on the indictment are of considerable importance.  We have received a statement from the victim of Count 2, the appellant’s mother, made quite recently in which she sets out her views of the sentence which was imposed.  Whether that is actually admissible on the appeal or not we consider that it is important that the court dealing with the appeal is fully informed about the opinions of any family member who wishes to express an opinion to the court.  The sensitivity of the case is significant.  That is the reason why we have decided that the appeal will be heard on another day when the prosecution can be represented and when these matters can be attended to fully.

Judgment
Lord Justice Burnett:
1.
The appellant appeals with leave of the single judge against a sentence of 15 years detention in a Young Offender Institution imposed on 17 April 2014 in the Crown Court at Snaresbrook by His Honour Judge Radford following his earlier conviction on 14 March of the attempted murder of Ismail Khan
.
The appellant also renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction relying exclusively upon fresh evidence which is said to undermine the safety of the conviction. Lengthy grounds of appeal against conviction were rejected by the single judge. They focussed on alleged shortcomings in the conduct of the defence. None of those grounds is relied upon any longer.
The Conviction Application
2.
These proceedings came before the full court on 12 June 2015. The “fresh evidence” comprises a statement referring to a short exchange of BlackBerry electronic messaging between Sohil Choudhury, who was a witness for the prosecution at the trial, and someone we shall call Jane. At the hearing we made an order that there shall be no publication of any material that identifies who Jane is or provides details which could lead to her identification as being concerned in these appellate proceedings. No detail is available in Jane’s statement or in a statement from the appellant’s solicitor reporting a further conversation with Jane of when the exchanges are said to have occurred. The appellant submits that the exchanges suggest that Choudhury falsely stitched him up as responsible for the attack. He relies also on a number of images said to have been taken from Choudhury’s Instagram profile, similarly undated, which suggest that he had a criminal lifestyle. The evidence produced is limited to screenshots of the material exchanges and pages which were apparently downloaded via a school computer. There was no evidence available in June to provide any credible link between that evidence and Choudhury himself. It was in those circumstances that the matter was adjourned for further investigation. By paragraph 2 of its order 12 June the court
“Directed the applicant within a period of ten days, to present to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) such material as would enable the CPS, through the offices of the police, to look at the material with a view to assisting in the investigation of its alleged provenance”
3.
The grounds of appeal are:
“i.
The evidence produced by [Jane] which indicates that [the appellant] had been falsely implicated in the attack should be before the Jury on any re-trial of the case that may be ordered.
ii. The evidence showing that [Choudhury] was involved in the sale of drugs would have allowed the defence to put forward a credible motive to lie, and to implicate the Applicant. In addition such material would have assisted the making of a s100 application.”
Mr Josse QC, who appears for the appellant, has not pressed the second ground because it was squarely before the jury that Choudhury was a drug dealer and it was also clear from their verdicts relating to other defendants that they did not accept much of his evidence.
4.
The court’s concern in June was that in the absence of any demonstrable link between Choudhury and the material in the screenshots, the evidence could not carry the proposed appeal anywhere. We note that the Crown’s argument is, come what may, that the material does not undermine the conviction. The two issues which arise on the relevant statutory provisions in the
Criminal Appeal Act 1968
[“
the 1968 Act
”] relating to fresh evidence may be summarised as:
i.
Is the evidence reliable or as
section 23(2)(a)
of
the 1968 Act
puts it “capable of belief”; and
ii.
Does it appear that it may afford a ground of appeal:
section 23(2)(a)
.
5.
On 1 December 2014 the appellant’s solicitor was contacted by his mother who indicated that a witness, Jane, had fresh evidence to give. A colleague, Krystle O’Donnell, made arrangements to see Jane. They met on 19 and 30 December. At the second meeting some documents were provided to Ms O’Donnell with the balance being sent on 13 January 2015. Thereafter a statement was drafted and sent to Jane for signature. It was returned on 2 February. There appears to have been no attempt to secure any device which might provide proper evidence in the sense of being able to demonstrate that the messages and images of which Jane had provided screenshots came from Choudhury.
6.
In her statement Jane said that she was a Facebook friend of Choudhury. She had seen a photograph on his Facebook page which included someone she knew as “Ads” who she had not seen around for a while and asked Choudhury who he was. She had never spoken to Ads. Why she had an interest in Ads is unexplained. Ads is the appellant. The first exchanges were via Facebook. A single page has been copied which does not contain the whole exchange but includes Jane saying “I need to talk to you about something rt please”. RT usually means “real talk”. The screenshot shows a BlackBerry PIN number in the reply and records, “Sent 6 Apr”. That cannot be a reference to 2015. If it refers to 2014, it would appear that Jane initiated this contact between the dates of conviction and sentence. There is nothing on the screenshots of the BlackBerry messaging exchange to indicate when it occurred. In her statement Jane indicated that the BlackBerry exchange followed the Facebook exchange. She exhibited the BlackBerry messages and added “I do not remember the exact time of this conversation but it was a few months ago.” She produced “examples” of photographs of Choudhury from his Instagram profile supporting what she said were his boasts of “cannabis, large amounts of money and weapons”. Rather enigmatically she added “I have given these documents to a previous solicitor but I do not know if they were used”. There is no explanation of that anywhere in the material before us.
7.
Following the hearing in this court in June, Ms O’Donnell met Jane. Her statement explains Jane’s evidence relating to both the Blackberry and her Facebook account. At that meeting the screenshots already referred to were provided by Jane to the solicitor on a USB stick with an explanation that they had been downloaded using a school computer. Jane said that her BlackBerry broke in about February 2015 and was taken from her by her parents. She could not recall the phone number. She thinks it was a pay as you go phone and was registered with another relative. Jane could not remember her PIN or the associated messaging account. The timing and circumstances in which she downloaded the screenshots to a memory stick from a school computer and how the images got onto that computer are not explored or explained. So far as her Facebook account was concerned, Jane said she used Facebook until about February or March this year. The implication is that she stopped doing so then, although there is no indication why. She provided her user name and an associated email address, but could not remember her password. Jane said she had not deleted any content from her Facebook account.
8.
Jane’s parents were unaware of her contact with the solicitor and would not have approved of her contacting Choudhury via BlackBerry or social media.
9.
No doubt the expectation of both this court and the parties was that the BlackBerry would be provided and subjected to proper analysis; and also that Jane would enable access to her Facebook account to provide some prospect of an investigation whether the images said to come from Choudhury’s Facebook and Instagram postings in fact do so. PC Mark Evans, a specialist investigator of electronic evidence, was made available to examine whatever was produced by the appellant in compliance with this court’s order. He made a statement which was sent to the appellant’s solicitors under cover of a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service dated 15 August 2015.
10.
He identified the issue he was concerned with as whether the BlackBerry messages came from Choudhury. He observed that BlackBerry are ‘not very helpful and have in the past ignored all requests.’ He then made a series of points relating to the BlackBerry.
1.
A BlackBerry Messenger account is easy to set up by buying a pay as you go BlackBerry. A BlackBerry Messenger account is unique to the phone, but anyone can set up a BlackBerry Messenger server and use it to transfer messages untraceably.
2.
Photographs of the kind shown in the screenshots can be copied in from various sources, which include Facebook and other social media sites or uploaded from the internet. The screenshots appear to be from a mobile phone, but carry no date or time, and no confirmation of who the message is from.
3.
There is no evidence that Choudhury sent the messages. Neither the fact that the account appears to be in Choudhury’s name, nor the fact that he is in the pictures provides such evidence.
4.
Without access to the telephone or to the BlackBerry Messenger account, it is not possible to check which BlackBerry Messenger PIN number was used to send any message, or when it was sent, or to whom that PIN belonged. A person can set up many accounts and ‘talk’ to him or herself.
5.
The reference to a PIN in the body of the message does not take matters further. It appears to have been superimposed on the message, rather than being part of it. The fact that the PIN is in a message does not show that it is the PIN from which the message came. Choudhury’s BlackBerry Messenger PIN would be known to anyone who communicated with him via BlackBerry.
11.
PC Evans found Jane’s Facebook account but it was completely locked down. All that was visible was the opening page with a photograph posted on 12 April 2014. No content was visible.
12.
This survey of recent events and the nature of the evidence relied upon by the appellant leads to the conclusion that matters are no further forward than they were in June. It is in those circumstances that Mr Josse applies for the application to be adjourned once more to enable further investigations to be undertaken. He submits that an adjournment is necessary to allow one of three things to happen: for this court to
(i)
exercise the power conferred by
section 23A
of
the 1968 Act
to direct the Criminal Cases Review Commission [“CCRC”] to investigate the evidence of Jane and report back to the court, before deciding the question of leave; or
(ii)
direct the CPS to make further inquiries; or
(iii)
authorise public funding to enable the appellant’s solicitors to make further inquiries.
Mr Josse submits that the first of these options is the most appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
13.
The scheme of
section 23A
allows the Court of Appeal to direct the CCRC to investigate in connection with an application for leave to appeal against conviction. It may do so if the matter to be investigated is relevant to the determination of the application and ought, if possible, to be resolved before the application is determined. Further, that the matter cannot be resolved without an investigation by the CCRC. The “matter” which Mr Josse invites us to refer for investigation is the question whether the BlackBerry messages and other social media content came from Choudhury. If the CCRC route were not adopted, it is the same matter that he submits needs investigation by either the CPS or solicitors.
14.
We see an insuperable difficulty with any and all of these suggestions. Jane has provided a series of screenshots but the lack of supporting information is such that any meaningful investigation is impossible. Mr Josse submits that the language of PC Evans does not conclusively shut out the possibility that BlackBerry itself might be able to help and inquiries might be made of Facebook. The lack of response PC Evans reports is familiar to the court. Both BlackBerry and Facebook are American corporations, which further circumscribes the scope for seeking assistance. But in any event, the absence of critical information to identify the relevant accounts provides an effective block.
15.
We are not persuaded that a further adjournment is justified to allow further investigation of the authenticity of the screenshots because there is no reason to suppose that it would advance matters at all.
16.
Mr Josse advances a subsidiary argument, namely that we should adjourn to enable Jane to attend to give evidence orally
de bene esse
to help inform the question whether her evidence is credible, albeit that she would be unlikely to shed any light on the authenticity of the communications she says she received. Mr Sandiford, for the Crown, submits that would be a pointless exercise because Jane cannot deal with the important question of authenticity, even if her evidence is otherwise capable of belief.
17.
The circumstances in which Jane’s evidence came to light, coupled with the loss of the phone and memory failures regarding PIN numbers, passwords etc for both BlackBerry and Facebook coupled with the striking lack of detail in her statement leads us to doubt whether her evidence is capable of belief. But it is unnecessary to reach a conclusion on that question because the fundamental problem with the evidence, canvassed before the court in June, remains. The screenshots could not be admitted as second-hand evidence from Choudhury because of the impossibility of establishing that he was the author of their content. For the purpose of
section 23
of
the 1968 Act
that content does not appear to be reliable.
18.
We decline the application for an adjournment. Mr Josse realistically submits that absent the adjournment he is not in a position to advance the application for leave to appeal against conviction. We agree. In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to explore in detail the alternative submission advanced by Mr Sandiford, namely that the very short extracts from the BlackBerry messages relied upon (if from Choudhury) do not support the contention that Choudhury falsely accused the appellant of involvement in the attack. It is sufficient to record that there is substance in that submission. Additionally, Mr Sandiford reminded us that the Crown’s case against the appellant did not rely at all upon the evidence of Choudhury. His identification of the appellant came as a surprise. He had not identified him in either of his ABE interviews and did not mention him to the police as being involved in the attack upon Ismail Khan. There was powerful evidence from the victim who identified the appellant from an unusual scar on his lip and nose (visible despite wearing a head covering) and striking gait when he ran away. The appellant’s alibi was demonstrated to be false. Cell-site evidence placed him at the scene and his telephone ceased to be used straight after the attack and was then disposed of. This was a strong case without Choudhury.
19.
The application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused.
The Sentence Appeal
20.
Ismail Khan, who was 15, was attacked with a hammer in a residential street in East London on the evening of 7 October 2012 by two assailants who had covered their heads. They ran off. He was with Choudhury. Ismail Khan was struck a number of times and suffered a fractured skull in three places. The appellant had just passed his seventeenth birthday. He and Ismail Khan were both pupils at Kingsford Community School. The year before Ismail Khan and the appellant’s younger sister had formed a relationship of some sort and went missing for 24 hours. There was concern that the appellant might seek retribution against Ismail Khan. A meeting was arranged which involved teachers, the police, both sets of parents and two boys. The meeting was heated and the appellant threatened Ismail Khan.
21.
The head injury was serious and required extensive surgical intervention with substantial short-term problems with walking, blurred vision and loss of hearing. Those resolved but, as the judge recorded, Ismail Khan suffered “long term effects in terms of the psychological effect on his personality and his ability to enjoy life, to progress in his education, as has been said so clearly in the statements, the victim personal statements that I have read and considered.” As is so often the case with head injury, the immediate physical consequences resolve or substantially diminish but long-term significant psychological, personality and intellectual problems remain.
22.
This was a planned revenge attack about a year after the incident which had offended the appellant. The appellant continued to deny the offence after his conviction. The mitigation available to him was that he was only 17 when he committed the offence and that he had no previous convictions. Mr Josse submits that in arriving at a sentence of 15 years the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the youth of this appellant and, although reciting the background, failed to appreciate that there were cultural issues in play which must have imposed subtle pressure on the appellant to do something.
23.
The prosecution had advanced this case before the jury on the basis that it was “an attempt at a so-called honour killing”. The qualification “so-called” is very important. Normally when the word “honour” is used it conveys a sense of something noble or worthwhile. Attacks on women or girls, or the boys or young men with whom it is said they have behaved inappropriately, have nothing to do with honour. They are vile crimes, nothing less. We do not accept that an adult committing a revenge attack of this sort could suggest that such motivation provided any mitigation whatsoever. The position may be less clear-cut with a child or young person, just as it is when sentencing judges are dealing with young or vulnerable offenders who have genuinely been put under tangible and substantial pressure into committing any crime by identified family members or older friends. In this case there is no evidence at all that the appellant was put under any pressure to do what he did. On the contrary, when the events involving his sister and Ismail Khan occurred the previous year the evidence suggests that the pressure exerted was entirely the other way, including by his parents. A vague appeal to “cultural pressures” cannot assist any more than it would, for example, were a 17 year-old to beat someone up in a revenge attack for a perceived insult to his girlfriend and then said his response was the normal way of dealing with such matters in his family and social circles.
24.
The judge directed himself correctly by reference to the Definitive Guideline relating to attempted murder. Mr Josse accepts that the judge located this offending at the right place within the guideline. This was a level 2 offence on the cusp between the bracket appropriate for “serious and long-term harm” (17 – 25 years’ custody) and “some physical or psychological harm” (12 – 20 years’ custody). The age of the victim was an aggravating factor and, as the judge recognised, the age of the appellant a mitigating factor. In arriving at a sentence of 15 years’ detention it is apparent that the judge allowed a significant discount to reflect the appellant’s youth. We do not agree that the sentence can properly be described as manifestly excessive. It was an appropriate sentence for this attempted murder.
Conclusion
25.
We dismiss both the application for leave to appeal against conviction and the appeal against sentence.","citation:

Lord Justice Latham: This is an application by the Attorney General under
section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988
in the case of two offenders, Gary Walker, who is 23 years of age, and Dean Walsh, who is 20 years of age. For an offence of attempted robbery they were sentenced to four years in custody - as far as the offender Walker was concerned that was four years' imprisonment and as far as Walsh was concerned that was four years' detention in a young offender institution -- at Chester Crown Court on 22nd February 2005. In addition, the offender Walker was sentenced to a concurrent term of four months' imprisonment in respect of an offence of driving whilst disqualified.
2.
We give leave to the Attorney General to make the reference.
3.
The sentences arise out of the events of 14th December 2004, when, at about 9.45 in the morning, a small family run sub-post office in the village of Pickmere was the subject of an attempted robbery by these two young men who had driven to the village from Manchester. The sub-post office consists of single room premises with a solid glass screen in front of the post office element of the shop. The shop had a closed circuit television system and a panic alarm. It had been the subject, unhappily, of robberies in the past. The shop was run by a Mr Gates, who is 66 years old, and his wife, Mrs Gates, 59, who effectively lived on the premises.
4.
The first that anybody suspected about the robbery was when a passer-by saw the two offenders sitting in their car parked not far from the post office. She was suspicious of the two young men and made a mental note of part of the registration number. It would appear as though the two young men were at that stage planning the attack, because it was only a matter of minutes later that they got out of the car, wearing balaclava style masks, and were seen by Mrs Gates coming towards and then coming into the shop. She thought that one of them (the offender Walsh) was carrying what looked like a baseball bat, about 3 foot in length. She then pressed the panic button which activated the alarm. The next thing she knew was the sound of the smashing of the security screen by a sledge hammer wielded by one of the offenders.
5.
At that stage Mr Gates came into the shop, again protected by the security screen, which, despite the fact that the sledge hammer had made a hole in it, had fortunately held firm. Mr Gates bravely told the offenders to get out, despite the fact that they were demanding money, saying, ""hand over the money"". But it became obvious to them that Mr Gates and his wife were determined to stand their ground and not hand over the money. One of the offenders, it would appear the offender Walker, then said to Walsh that they should leave, which they did. They got into their car and drove off.
6.
The police had been notified of both the attack and the registration number of the vehicle, which was then chased by the police back into Manchester. It was eventually stopped; and the offenders were arrested. They were wearing gloves. Two balaclavas were found in the vehicle, as was a sledge hammer and a metal bar. They were interviewed and made no comment in their interviews. They were charged and pleaded guilty ultimately at the first plea and directions hearing.
7.
The judge was not asked to consider any pre-enquiry reports. The only matters relating to the antecedents of these two offenders which were before him were their records. The offender Walker had previous convictions, but had not been subject to any punishment other than a community penalty in the past. The offender Walsh, however, had more serious convictions. In particular, he had been sentenced on 11th August 2000 to four years' detention in a young offender institution, having pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. It was in those circumstances that the judge sentenced these two offenders to the custodial period of four years to which we have referred.
8.
The submission of the Attorney General made by Mr Davies on his behalf is quite simply that in the light of both authority and the advice of the Sentencing Guidelines Council the sentences are quite simply wrong as being unduly lenient. He has referred us, in particular, to
Attorney General's
Reference No 7 of 1992
14 Cr App R(S) 122, which affirmed the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, in
Attorney
General's Reference No 14 of 1991
(1991) 13 Cr App R(S) 446.
9.
The position in both those cases was that the offenders had robbed small shop premises. On each occasion they were armed, in the one case with a replica firearm and in the other with a pistol capable of firing blank cartridges. They had been sentenced to sentences of two and three years' imprisonment.
10.
Lord Lane in
Attorney General's Reference No 14
stated at page 449:
""... it is very seldom that in these circumstances a sentence of much less than seven years would be appropriate, the purpose of the sentence of that length being threefold: first of all to deter the offender from behaving in this way again; secondly to deter others from arming themselves with weapons and holding up banks; and thirdly, a matter which is sometimes overlooked, to punish the offender for having carried out this wicked crime and having put several people in fear of death.""
11.
That was the quotation which was repeated in
Attorney
General's Reference No 7
by Lord Taylor, and, it seems to us, provides the appropriate guidance to courts in cases such as these. It should be noted that in both of those cases there had been pleas of guilty and that is the context in which the remarks of both the Lord Chief Justices were made.
12.
In the present case clearly there is this difference, that the offenders were not armed with pistols or imitation firearms. Nonetheless, they were armed. They were armed with a sledge hammer and what Mrs Gates believed to be a baseball bat, but was probably the iron bar. That necessarily involved, and was intended to involve, putting those in the shop in fear. It was only the steadfastness of Mr and Mrs Gates which prevented them from being able to achieve their objective.
13.
We have taken into account the submissions made on the offenders' behalf. As far as the offender Walker is concerned, it is pointed out that he has no previous convictions for a serious offence of this sort. He had personal mitigation in relation to the circumstances in which he found himself and which drove him to commit this offence. It would appear that he may well have been the one who urged that the two of them should leave when it was apparent that they were unlikely to be able to obtain their objective, at least easily, and he has behaved well in prison.
14.
As far as the offender Walsh is concerned, we are asked to take into account his age, and a further factor which has arisen since he was sentenced, which is that he now serves an additional two year sentence for conspiracy to commit criminal damage relating to events in prison, which was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence with which we are concerned.
15.
Both counsel ask us, in particular, to take into account the fact that the offenders pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.
16.
In our view, despite that mitigation, the sentences that were imposed on these two young men were clearly unduly lenient. Whilst it may be that there should be some discount from the suggested figure of seven years' imprisonment to reflect the fact that they were not carrying pistols or imitation firearms of any sort, nonetheless, the gravamen and seriousness of this offence remains similar to that in the two cases to which we have been referred.
17.
Premises such as these are vulnerable. They require protection by the courts. Those who seek to rob from them, and in so doing intend to put those in the shops in fear, must expect long sentences. We do not think that in those circumstances, even taking account the element of double jeopardy, it would be right for this Court to do other than to impose a sentence in each case of six years in custody. That would be six years' imprisonment so far as the offender Walker is concerned and six years' detention so far as the offender Walsh is concerned.","citation:

Applicant

J U D G M E N T
1.
MRS JUSTICE COX: This applicant, Michael May, who is now 53 years of age, pleaded guilty at the Southend Crown Court to recklessly acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft, contrary to article 73 to the Air Navigation Order 2005 made under the
Civil Aviation Act 1982
. On 31st July 2009 he was sentenced to a term of six months' imprisonment. His application for leave to appeal against that sentence has been referred directly to this court.
2.
The facts briefly are these. Whilst on holiday in Thailand, the applicant, who lives in Chadwell St. Mary in Essex, had purchased a laser device as a novelty. In the early hours of the morning on 25th April 2008 the crew of a police helicopter, who were carrying out a surveillance mission, were flying over Chadwell St. Mary when the applicant, who lived in a block of flats, shone the laser light into the cockpit of the helicopter. As a result the pilot was temporarily dazed and disoriented and had to terminate the surveillance. The crew were then forced to terminate the search in order to avoid potential injury to themselves. They were, however, able to identify the source of the light using thermal imaging and identified the block of flats, where the officers saw a window open and the applicant standing at it. Subsequently officers attended the flats and arrested the applicant.
3.
In his written basis of plea the applicant denied that his shining of the light was a deliberate and sustained attack by him, but he did accept that his actions were in all the circumstances reckless. He therefore fell to be sentenced on that basis.
4.
The applicant had only one previous conviction in 1996 for three offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception for which he was fined. The judge treated him as effectively a man of good character.
5.
Passing sentence upon him, the judge referred to the very grave risks he had caused, creating life-threatening danger to the pilot, his crew and to members of the public on the ground if there had been an accident. He also referred to the fact that the use of such lasers was becoming increasingly common and to the need for a deterrent sentence in the circumstances. He took the view that the offence was so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence could be justified. He took into account the fact that no accident or injury was in fact sustained on this occasion and he had regard in addition to the applicant's personal mitigation, which included a number of continuing health problems. The sentence imposed was one of six months' imprisonment.
6.
On the applicant's behalf, Miss Kresner accepts, realistically, that this was a serious offence which crossed the custody threshold. She submits essentially that the judge failed sufficiently to take into account the applicant's significant disabilities. The applicant was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in 1997. As a result of his injuries he now has limited mobility in both legs, needing a stick to walk even for short distances, and he has lost the use of his left arm and hand. He lives in sheltered accommodation and requires special equipment and adaptations to assist with his daily living. Miss Kresner's submission is that in view of those disabilities the custodial sentence imposed should have been suspended.
7.
We cannot accept these submissions. This was, as she acknowledges, a very serious offence and the judge was entitled to regard it as such. As the judge observed, the applicant's reckless behaviour not only endangered the lives of the helicopter crew but put at risk members of the public on the ground if there had been an accident. The consequences were potentially catastrophic. We accept of course that the applicant has a number of permanent disabilities which create problems for him in everyday living, but in our view the judge adequately took these into account in imposing the sentence that he did. We note in addition that the prison reports available to us today refer to the fact that the applicant's mobility problems have not prevented him from engaging in a variety of prison activities and courses, which have been of real benefit to him. In our judgment this sentence cannot arguably be said to be manifestly excessive or wrong in principle and we therefore refuse leave to appeal.
8.
We would add the following observations in this case. We note that, notwithstanding the applicant's plea to acting recklessly, the judge conducted a
Newton
hearing, apparently in order to determine whether on the facts the applicant's conduct had amounted to a deliberate and sustained attack on the helicopter. In our judgment this was an unnecessary step. By his plea the applicant had admitted that he was aware of the risks posed by what he was doing, but nevertheless continued deliberately to shine the light at the helicopter. It was therefore unnecessary, for the purposes of considering the appropriate sentence, to enquire further into the facts or the applicant's conduct at the time.
9.
We refuse leave to appeal against the sentence for the reasons we have given.","citation:

Judgment
LORD JUSTICE PITCHFORD :
1.
On 14
th
September 2009 at Manchester Crown Court the respondent, whom we shall call “C”, faced an indictment containing six counts. The trial Judge, HHJ Steiger QC, upheld an application made on C’s behalf that the indictment should be stayed as to proceed would be an abuse of the process of the Court. This is an application by the prosecution for leave to appeal the Judge’s ruling under
section 58 Criminal Justice Act 2003
and rule 67.4 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
2.
It is first necessary to consider the background to the prosecution. C is a solicitor and equity partner in a firm of solicitors. At the relevant times he was the firm’s nominated anti-money laundering officer. An effect of that position was that each month the firm’s client account reconciliation reports would be submitted to him for approval. C’s professional obligation was to report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service or other appropriate authority any transactions through the firm’s client account which gave rise to suspicion that the use to which the account was being put was money laundering. No such reports were made by C during the period 2001 to 2004.
3.
The prosecution case is that a client of the firm, Amer Munir, committed a VAT acquisition tax fraud using a company called Talkland Telecom Limited. In November 2001 the company purported to buy and sell £40m pounds worth of mobile telephones. The VAT payable was some £6.5m. No VAT was ever paid.
4.
Munir’s brother-in-law was C’s partner in the firm. C had introduced him. Munir’s sister, Shamaila, was employed as a conveyancing clerk. The prosecution asserts that the firm was used by Munir to launder money fraudulently obtained from the VAT fraud through the firm’s client account for the purpose both of acquiring property and of transferring money between companies in which Munir had an interest. The indictment was framed as follows:
Count 1
is an allegation that, contrary to
section 93A(1)(b)
CJA
1988, between September 2001 and 19 March 2004 C entered into or was concerned in an arrangement by which money fraudulently obtained should be used by Munir to acquire and develop a housing and development site at Botham Hall Road, Huddlesfield.
Count 2
is a similar allegation in respect of a development site at Rappax Road, Hale.
Count 3
is an allegation that, contrary to
section 328 POCA
2002 (the successor to section 39A of the 1988 Act), between 24 February 2003 and 19 March 2004 C enabled Munir to retain control of or to use criminal property by making representations on his behalf to a firm of solicitors, Jens Hill and Company, acting for Vista Assistance SL, a Spanish registered company.
Count 4
is an allegation that, contrary to
section 328
, C enabled Munir to maintain control of or to use criminal property by allowing the firm’s client account to be used to move money to and from accounts held by Danish Electronic and Buss Merton LLP.
Count 5
is a similar allegation that C between 15 December 2003 and 20 December 2003, enabled Munir to maintain or control the use of criminal property by allowing £110,000 to be transferred from the firm’s client account to the credit of Saeed Ahmed at UBS Bank, Switzerland.
Count 6
is a similar allegation that C, between 15 December 2003 and 20 December 2003 enabled Munir to maintain or to control the use of criminal property by allowing £47, 000 to be transferred from the firm’s client account to the credit of Mohammed Munir, Amer Munir’s father.
5.
In any trial of C upon these counts it would be necessary for the prosecution to prove that the sums passing through the firm’s client account were in fact Munir’s proceeds of crime; secondly, that C was concerned in the arrangements or transactions alleged; thirdly, that at the time of the arrangements or transactions in which he was concerned, C knew or suspected that their purpose was to acquire, retain, use or control criminal property by or on behalf of Munir.

In March 2004 Amer Munir was arrested and interviewed. He made no comment to the allegations put to him. He and his wife were tried on a 19 count indictment by HHJ Gee QC and a jury between 23 November 2006 and 21 December 2006. Mr Munir was convicted on six counts and acquitted on five. Formal verdicts of not guilty were entered on three counts at the end of the prosecution case. The jury disagreed on three counts. Mr Munir’s wife was acquitted on all counts in which she was concerned. The effect of these verdicts upon the indictment in C’s case is as follows:
i)
The Munir jury disagreed upon the allegations underlying counts 1 and 2 faced by C.
ii)
The Munir jury convicted Amer Munir in respect of the allegations now reflected against C in counts 4 and 5.
iii)
The Munir jury found Amer Munir not guilty of the criminal conduct in respect of which C is now charged in count 6.
It follows that the prosecution would need to prove Munir’s criminal conduct and Munir’s receipt of criminal proceeds in respect of all counts except that, in the case of counts 4 and 5, the prosecution would be able to rely upon his convictions under
section 74 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
.
7.
C was arrested and interviewed on 29
th
April 2004. He gave full answers to the questions put based upon documentary evidence obtained in the course of the enquiry. The second interview took place on 18 January 2005 following which C was released without charge. No further step was taken in the prosecution of C until January 2008 when he was summonsed for alleged offences of money laundering. Following preliminary proceedings, C’s trial was listed for 20 October 2008. On 10 September 2008 the prosecution served 79 pages of witness statements and 555 pages of exhibits. A week later 30 further pages of witness statements were served together with 3400 pages of exhibits. Although the prosecution subsequently argued that only 40 pages of the additional material were relevant, it was apparent to Mr Webster QC that the defence expert would need to consider all of the documents. It had been noted that contemporaneous documents completed by managers of banks who had dealt with Munir referred to him in terms which recommended him as a client. That material was relevant to the issue whether C himself had been misled by Munir or was complicit in his scheme. An application to vacate the trial date, made on 2 October 2008, was granted and the trial re-listed for 23 March 2009.
8.
On 23
rd
March 2009 the parties appeared before HHJ Steiger QC for trial. A few days before trial the prosecution had served on the defence a request to make formal admissions to the effect that Munir had been convicted at his trial. Surprisingly, the defence team was unaware that Munir had also been acquitted of several charges and the jury had failed to agree on others. The defence argued that they were taken by surprise and it was unfair to C to proceed. The Judge ordered severance of the indictment because the defence were placed at a disadvantage, and that the trial should continue upon count 3 alone. He ruled that notwithstanding severance the prosecution should be entitled to rely upon the evidence which they would have produced to prove the other counts in the original indictment. On the following day the procedural situation was reviewed by the Judge. The prosecution had disclosed transcripts of evidence from the Munir trial which alerted the defence to the possibility that they could challenge the assertion that C’s client account had been used to launder the proceeds of crime. The defence made an application for an adjournment which was successful. The trial was fixed for 14 September 2009. On that day, Mr Webster QC made a successful application to stay the indictment.
9.
Before HHJ Steiger QC the defence application centred upon the period of delay between C’s interviews, concluded in January 2005, and the date of trial, 14 September 2009. In short, the Judge concluded that, contrary to the submissions of Mr Wigglesworth QC on behalf of the prosecution, this was not a trial whose outcome would depend upon the jury’s analysis of documents. The principal issues were (1) C’s knowledge of the purpose behind admitted transactions and (2) whether C knew or suspected that he and his firm were assisting a money laundering exercise.
10.
The first issue for the trial Judge was the date from which time ran for the purposes of the judgement of delay. He was referred to the decision of the House of Lords in
Attorney General’s Reference
No. 2 of 2001
(2003) UKHL 68
. It was contended on behalf of the prosecution that time did not begin to run until the respondent was notified of the intention to prosecute by service of the summonses in January 2008. The respondent submitted that the start date should be taken to be April 2004 or January 2005. The prosecution had made a deliberate decision not to join C in the prosecution of Munir. That decision was confirmed in writing by Mr Wigglesworth QC on 6 October 2006. The Judge concluded at paragraph 16(c) of the note of his ruling that:
“Although there was disagreement at the Bar about when precisely time in the present case should run for the purpose of Article 6, I consider that the relevant moment is when a clear decision has been made to prosecute a defendant who is available to be charged. I therefore see June 2006 as the latest moment to “start the clock” rather than the interview (as Mr Webster suggests) or the summons (according to Mr Wigglesworth)”.
11.
Lord Bingham said at paragraph 27 of his opinion, in
Attorney General’s Reference
2
of 2001
:
“27. As a general rule the relevant period will begin at the earliest time at which a person is officially alerted to the likelihood of criminal proceedings against him. This formulation gives effect to the Strasbourg jurisprudence but may (it is hoped) prove easier to apply in this Country. In applying it, regard must be had to the purposes of the reasonable time requirement: to ensure that criminal proceedings, once initiated, are prosecuted without undue delay; and to preserve defendants from the trauma of awaiting trial for an inordinate period. The Court of Appeal correctly held…. that the period would ordinarily begin when a defendant is formally charged or served with a summons but it wisely forbore…. to lay down any inflexible rules.”
There is, accordingly, no hard and fast rule as to the assessment of the relevant period for the purposes of Article 6. In
Burns v HM Advocate, Advocate/General for Scotland Intervening
Times Law Reports 26 December 2008, the Privy Council advised that the assessment of the relevant period should be made in such a way as to give effect to article 6.1 if to do otherwise would deprive the accused of its effect. There was, it seems to us, a respectable argument available to the respondent to the effect that where the prosecution deliberately withholds from a suspect the information that they intend to proceed but wish to await the outcome of other proceedings, it would be artificial to judge the period of delay only from the moment when the summons is eventually served and that, in those circumstances, time begins to run from the date of interview. Mr Wigglesworth QC, on behalf of the applicant, was not disposed to challenge the Judge’s decision upon the issue in argument before us since, as he recognised, the real issue was the effect of admitted delay upon the prospects for a fair trial. We do not propose to interfere with the Judge’s assessment that he should examine the period since June 2006.
12.
There was little dispute before the Judge and none before this Court that the prosecution had been guilty of undue delay if only because, while Mr Wigglesworth QC had advised that summonses should be issued immediately following the trial of Munir, no summons was issued until January 2008. It was not disputed that the trial Judge was entitled to examine the whole of the period since June 2006 for the purpose of judging whether delay had been causative of relevant prejudice to the accused.
13.
Mr Wigglesworth QC repeated to us the submissions he had made to the trial Judge to the effect that this was in essence a prosecution upon the documents. In response, Mr Webster emphasised the significance of the oral evidence of witnesses. The oral witnesses fell into four categories. The first comprised the experts. An attempt was made by the expert for the Crown to reconstruct Law Society guidance to practising solicitors as to their responsibilities for reporting suspected money laundering activities. It was no longer possible to be precise since changes had been made on dates which the experts were no longer able to ascertain. Secondly, members and employees of C’s firm would give evidence about the transactions documented. Their recollection of the purpose behind those transactions, as they were understood at the time, was material to C’s defence. In some cases, recollection of the fact and degree of C’s participation was at issue. The third category of witnesses comprised the other professional men, in particular a solicitor in a distant firm who also enabled transactions for which Munir was responsible. Since those transactions were linked to those in respect of which C was charged, his recollection both of the nature of the transactions and of his impression of Munir and his substance would be important. There were, in addition, several bank employees in respect of whom contemporaneous records provided the defence with material for cross examination should they give evidence for the prosecution or be tendered. Lastly, the defendant’s own recollection was in issue. While C had been interviewed at length about the transactions in which he was implicated, he was, or said he was, in several respects, unsure of the detail.
14.
In his conclusions the Judge summarised the principles of law to be applied as follows;
“(a) the persuasive burden in an application to stay proceedings on the grounds of delay rests with the defence and not the prosecution;
(b) The trial should only be stayed if a fair trial is impossible and no other less draconian techniques are available to moderate the unfairness such as severance, exclusion of evidence or directions in summing up;
(c)
[start date for delay]
...;
(d) Cases dependant upon documents rather than recollection are less prone to being stayed.”
No criticism is made of the Judge’s identification of the principles which guided his analysis. The Judge identified knowledge or suspicion that Munir had been engaged in some form of criminal conduct as one of the principal issues for the jury. He continued:
“18. If it is a correct analysis to see the case against [C] as depending in the main on his state of mind the case cannot in my judgement depend wholly on documents since no single document referred to deals conclusively with that topic. Of course, inferences may be drawn from documents if the circumstances merit but this is not a case to my mind where the inference of guilty knowledge is inevitable. Even the apparently incriminating attendance notes following the Jens Hill letter are explicable by Mans Uddin seeking to avoid tax in Spain given the evidence of Mr Main. A further factor which undermines the strength of any document-based inference against [C] is that Munir’s sister worked for Megson Ponsonby from home and her husband was a member of the firm. There were thus at least two other actors within the firm with connections to Munir quite apart from the defendant or any other employee such as Ian Hannam who dealt with conveyancing and with Golbourn who dealt with accounts.
19. I therefore accept the submission of Mr Webster that despite the documents the case really depends on the recollection of individual witnesses about events up to eight years ago and in dealing with the defendant’s knowledge or suspicion such a delay undoubtedly places the defendant at a disadvantage…
23. I recognise that to stay proceedings is an exceptional course but I am persuaded by Mr Webster that a fair trial is not now possible and nothing short of a stay can achieve fairness to the defendant. For these reasons the application succeeds.”
15.
We have been troubled by the absence in the Judge’s ruling of an explanation for his conclusion that the process of trial would not itself have rendered C’s trial fair. There were a number of procedural and evidential steps which the trial Judge could have taken to minimise any disadvantage under which the respondent may have laboured. First, unless the respondent was able to discharge the burden of demonstrating obvious prejudice, the Judge was entitled to reject the application and, if the circumstances warranted, revisit his decision either at the close of the prosecutions case or at the close of all the evidence. As Hooper LJ observed in
Burke
(2005) EWCA Crim 29
at paragraph 32:
“Prior to the start of the case it will often be difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether a defendant can have a fair trial because of the delay coupled with the destruction of documents and the unavailability of witnesses. Issues which might seem very important before the trial may become unimportant or of less importance as a result of developments during the trial, including the evidence of the complaint and other witnesses including the defendant should he choose to give evidence.”
The facts of the present case were very different but the same observation applies. Second, the Judge had wide powers to seek formal admissions from the parties and to admit, in the interests of justice hearsay evidence. Thirdly, the Judge was required to assess the impact of delay upon the issues in the trial upon which he was directing the jury. In a case in which the jury’s judgement of an accused’s state of mind may depend upon an imperfect recollection of events and impressions, he would be required to remind the jury that the burden of establishing guilt rested with the prosecution and that, if they considered it was reasonably possible that the defendant had been placed at a disadvantage upon the issue by reason of the lapse of time and imperfect memory, they should apply the burden and standard of proof to the issue in the defendant’s favour.
16.
We have considered whether the absence of such an analysis from the Judge’s ruling should cause us to interfere. We are conscious that the question for us is not whether any member of the Court would have reached the same decision as the trial Judge but whether his decision could not reasonably have been reached. As Sir Igor Judge, then President of the Queens Bench Division, put it in
Regina v B
(2008) EWCA Crim 1144
:
“No trial Judge should exercise his discretion in a way in which he personally believes may be unreasonable. That is not to say that he will necessarily find every such decision easy. But the mere fact that the Judge could reasonably have reached the opposite conclusion to the one he reached, and that he acknowledges that there were valid arguments that might have caused him to do so, does not begin to provide a basis for a successful appeal….”
HHJ Steiger QC provided, in his ruling, a comprehensive analysis of the prosecution and its background, summarised the position of the parties, accurately stated the principles upon which he should act and explained the basis for his decision. We do not conclude that the absence of the “process of trial” analysis deprives the Judge’s ruling of its essential reasoning. This experienced trial Judge was well aware both of the issue to be considered and the matters relevant to it. We are unwilling to interfere with his conclusion that a fair trial was not possible on the ground that undue delay had created incurable prejudice in an examination of the respondent’s case.
17.
While the Judge was critical of the prosecution’s election to proceed against the accused sequentially, we have read Mr Wigglesworth’s opinion dated 6
th
October 2006, and we are quite satisfied that his advice was, in the context of the time, sustainable. We do not consider that it could be argued that the prosecution had manipulated the process for its own advantage and we note that no such finding was made by the Judge.
18.
We refuse the applicant leave to appeal and verdicts of acquittal will be entered on each count.","citation:

Judgment
Lord Justice Kennedy :
1.
On 26
th
June 2003 at the Central Criminal Court this appellant was convicted of six counts of rape and was sentenced to a total of 12 years imprisonment. He now appeals against conviction by leave of the single judge, who granted leave to appeal only in respect of two grounds, and referred a third ground of appeal to this court. The appellant also renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence after refusal by the single judge.
Facts.
2.
The appellant is a native of St Lucia who first came to the United Kingdom in 1976, and then on a more permanent basis in 1986. He says that in St Lucia he worked in government service and as a senior trade union official. He lived with a woman who we refer to only as Simone. By her he had four children two of whom died. The other two were girls, JT born in April 1984 and J born in January 1986. It is his behaviour towards that last mentioned child which forms the subject matter of the indictment in this case.
3.
After the appellant came to the United Kingdom in 1986 he met and married Patricia, with whom he then lived. He had three children by her born between March 1988 and November 1990.
4.
In about 1992 the appellant formed a relationship with a third woman, Lorna, by whom he had three more children between January 1994 and October 1997.
5.
During that period, in late 1994, Simone brought her two children to the United Kingdom because the eldest was suffering from sickle cell anaemia. In about February 1995 Simone returned to St Lucia leaving those two children with Lorna. J, the alleged victim, was then just 9 years of age.
6.
The prosecution case was that between 1995 and 1998 the appellant regularly sexually abused J at various addresses, namely the home of Patricia and the appellant, the home of Lorna, and an empty flat. There was no complaint at the time, but that, it is submitted, was because the appellant was a dominating, commercially successful and powerful man.
7.
On 21
st
January 1999 J’s sister, JT, was in hospital and told a nurse, Jacqueline Johnstone, that her father had been having sex with her sister. That resulted in J being seen on the following day. She confirmed that her father had been having sex with her, and there was then an interview which was video- recorded in which she said that it had happened at the various addresses with which she was associated, and that the last occasion was in August 1998. There was one occasion, she said in a second video interview, when at Patricia’s address Patricia came in to the room whilst the appellant was having sex with her and the appellant threw a towel into Patricia’s face.
8.
J was medically examined by Dr Susan West who found her to be a 13 year old girl with no obvious abnormalities. The examiner could introduce two gloved fingers into the vaginal opening with no discomfort, and felt no tight residual hymenal ring. She said that her findings were consistent with an allegation of penile penetration, and with not being a virgin, but she could not assess the number of times that penetration had occurred.
9.
Dr Aziz was also an experienced examiner but she did not examine the complainant. She relied on the evidence of Dr West as to what could be found, and she concluded that there had been no pre-puberty penile penetration because there were no signs of damage.
10.
The initial investigations took a little time, and it was the prosecution case that the appellant, a man of good character, was using that time to set up the outline of his defence, which was that J had had sexual relations before she left St Lucia (at the age of 8½), that all of the allegations against him were lies, and that J and her sister and the three older women – Simone, Lorna and Patricia – all had reasons to tell lies about him. He was interviewed in the presence of his solicitor in April 1999, and that is basically the position which he adopted then and thereafter.
The first trial.
11.
The appellant stood trial at the Central Criminal Court in October to November 1999, and was convicted of six counts of rape of J. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. On 18
th
July 2002 this court granted him leave to appeal on limited grounds, and his appeal was allowed on 16
th
December 2002. A re-trial was ordered, and it is against the decision reached at the conclusion of the re-trial that this appeal is brought.
Grounds of Appeal.
12.
The original grounds of appeal were drafted by leading counsel who appeared for the appellant at the re-trial, but who no longer represents him. The appellant also drafted grounds of appeal of his own. The single judge granted leave to appeal on two of the grounds drafted by counsel, namely –
(1) That the trial judge was wrong not to accede to a defence submission that the prosecution particularise the counts in the indictment at the close of the prosecution case, reliance being placed on
R v Rackham
[1997] 2 Cr App R 222
.
(2) That the trial judge was wrong not to allow Dr Aziz to be re-examined as to the size of the appellant’s semi-erect penis, which she had recorded. That was said to be relevant because she had said in cross-examination, as she had originally said in her witness statement, that the state of the hymen was consistent with penetration by things which included a smaller penis.
The single judge also referred to this court the appellant’s ground of appeal concerning the commission and treatment of hearsay evidence from nurse Jacqueline Johnstone, Lorna, and the complainant’s sister JT.
The appellant’s submissions.
13.
Mr Barlow, who now appears on behalf of the appellant, and to whom we are indebted, has taken a realistic and sensible attitude in relation to the first ground of appeal. He recognises, as we do, that there was evidence which, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, would have enabled the prosecution to formulate counts in relation to specific incidents, such as in particular the occasion when Patricia was alleged to have entered the room, but that would have been in addition to rather than in substitution for the existing counts, because the prosecution case could not be tied to a few isolated and identifiable occasions, so in reality the appellant lost nothing by the refusal of the judge to require further particularisation. That is why Mr Barlow, as he told us, finds the first ground of appeal difficult to argue. We agree with him that it is not really arguable, and we therefore turn to ground 2.
14.
We understand that at the first trial Dr Aziz produced a model to demonstrate the size of the appellant’s penis when erect in order to support her thesis that such an organ would have caused damage if inserted into the vagina of the child. It may be that those representing the appellant later came to the conclusion that the production of the model had been forensically counter-productive. We do not know, but we do know that at the second trial leading counsel for the appellant deliberately decided not to lead evidence from Dr Aziz in chief as to the measurements which she had taken of the appellant’s penis when semi-erect. Accepting the findings of Dr West, including the absence of any observations of damage, Dr Aziz concluded her examination in chief by saying “I do not think any penile penetration has taken place”. Mr Oliver Sells QC, for the Crown, then cross-examined by reference to the findings of Dr West, and referred Dr Aziz to her report, in which she had said that Dr West’s findings were consistent with the complainant having been penetrated by an object smaller than the defendant’s penis, such as a small penis, fingers or a similar sized object. It was against that background that Mr Rouch QC, for the appellant, sought to introduce in re-examination the measurements taken by Dr Aziz of the appellant’s penis. Mr Sells objected, and the judge then heard submissions and made his ruling in the absence of the jury. During the course of those submissions Mr Rouch said that he had not led the evidence in chief because of Dr West’s evidence (so clearly it was a deliberate decision not an oversight), but he contended that it became admissible in re-examination because Mr Sells had cross-examined about the size of the invading object. The judge disagreed. He ruled that if Mr Rouch wanted to introduce the evidence he should have done so in chief, and that Mr Sells had carefully cross-examined in a way that did not open the door to the introduction of the evidence in re-examination. Mr Barlow concedes that in law the stance taken by the Crown can be justified, but he invited us to consider the effect of the exclusion of the evidence that the appellant had a large penis on the safety of the conviction. He submits that if the jury had that in evidence it might have reinforced the defence argument that if J had been subjected to repeated intercourse with the appellant over a period of years as she alleged there would have been more damage, so, Mr Barlow submits, we should regard the convictions as unsafe.
15.
We turn now to the third ground of appeal which Mr Barlow put at the forefront of his case and which we gave him leave to argue. It can be summarised thus –
(1) In her evidence in chief Lorna said that in November 1998 she learnt from Patricia of her belief that the appellant was sexually involved with J, and she then spoke to J who broke down and said “it was all true and had been going on for years”, since just after her mother went back to St Lucia. That led Lorna to telephone the NSPCC, and it was accepted that she had done that.
(2) If, as J alleged, the last act of abuse was in August 1998 (or if Patricia was right September 1998) then what was said by J to Lorna in November 1998 could be regarded as admissible on the basis that it was a recent complaint, but whatever the basis of admission the jury had to be directed as to how such evidence should be approached, and no such direction was given.
In
Islam
[1999] 1 Cr App R 22
Buxton LJ at 39 pointed out that without an appropriate direction jurors may not realise that a complaint is not independent evidence of that which is complained of, because a witness cannot corroborate herself, and such a complaint only helps the jury to decide whether what has been said on oath is the truth. In that case the failure to give the direction resulted in the appeal being allowed.
16.
As was made clear in
Croad
[2001] EWCA Crim 644
, it does not matter how the complaint material gets before the jury. If they have heard a previous account by the complainant which does not of itself constitute evidence then the standard warning is required. In the present case the judge did no more than tell the jury to be quite careful about “second-hand evidence, that is comments which a witness makes about which they have no first-hand knowledge”. That warning was repeated by the judge when dealing with what JT told the nurse, but it was plainly not the standard warning to which we have referred, and Mr Barlow submits that the absence of that standard warning in this case renders the conviction unsafe.
The Respondent’s submissions.
17.
In relation to the evidence of Dr Aziz Mr Sells submitted that a tactical decision having been taken not to lead the particular evidence in chief the judge was right to rule as he did in relation to re-examination. Furthermore there was never any doubt as to the stance being taken by Dr Aziz, namely, as the judge said when summing-up –
“She had concluded that Dr West’s findings were consistent with penetration by an object smaller that the defendant’s penis, for example, smaller penis, fingers or similar objects…. What she says in her view there was no penetration pre-puberty, but she cannot exclude either a smaller penis or another object being introduced after puberty.”
So the jury was not in any way misled as to the effect of the evidence.
18.
Turning to ground 3 Mr Sells explained to us that before the start of the re-trial there was a discussion between counsel as to how to deal with the hearsay evidence, and in particular what the complainant and her sister were alleged to have said to others, much of which the defence wanted to introduce in order to support allegations of inconsistency. Thus the evidence of what the complainant was alleged to have said to Lorna in November 1998 was led, by the prosecution as part of the history, and, Mr Sells submitted, no “recent complaint” direction was required in relation to it. As Mr Sells points out, the trial judge invited counsel to indicate if there were any omissions or corrections to be made in relation to his summing-up, and nothing was said, so it is clear that at the time of the trial no counsel considered that a recent complaint direction was required.
Our conclusion on Grounds 1 to 3.
19.
For the reasons given in paragraph 13 above we are satisfied that there is no substance in the first ground of appeal.
20.
As to the second ground of appeal we consider that the evidence which Mr Rouch wanted to introduce in re-examination should have been admitted. The form of cross-examination was such that in our view the material became admissible in re-examination. But even if we are wrong about that, it seems to us that in a case such as this the judge should have hesitated to exclude evidence which was potentially relevant unless he came to the conclusion that the evidence had been deliberately withheld in order to introduce it at a later stage, or that its late production would be prejudicial to the prosecution case. It is not suggested that there was justification for either of those conclusions in this case. But the fact that, in our judgment, Mr Rouch should have be allowed to lead the evidence is not decisive. What matters is whether the absence of the evidence renders the convictions unsafe, and in our judgment it does not have that effect. As Mr Sells pointed out, the jury heard the evidence of Dr Aziz, and were reminded of it in the summing-up. They knew that in her opinion the state of the complainant’s private parts was not consistent with full penetrative sexual intercourse by an adult male over a period of years, but nevertheless they decided to convict. Even without measurements the point being made by Dr Aziz was easy to grasp, and we simply do not accept that the production of measurements would have had the decisive or even any significant effect. That must have been the opinion of at leading counsel for the defence when he examined Dr Aziz in chief, and in our opinion he was right.
21.
As to ground 3, the failure to assist the jury as to how to deal with the evidence of complaints, we accept that in general the appropriate warning should be given, but in this case it was accepted that by late 1998/early 1999 J was alleging to her sister as well as to Lorna that her father had been having sexual intercourse with her for some time, hence the conversation between JT and the nurse of 21
st
January 1999. For sound tactical reasons defence counsel wanted the jury to know what J was then saying. It was anticipated that it would be possible, by reference to that evidence, to demonstrate inconsistency. That being the issue which the jury was invited to consider we find it difficult to envisage what would have been the impact of the usual warning in this case. If, as we believe, the warning which should have been given would not have had any real impact, then its omission cannot render the conviction unsafe, and it is not surprising that the need for the warning did not even occur to counsel or to the trial judge. This conclusion takes account of the appellant’s letter of 23
rd
November 2004, and its enclosures, which was written to the court after we heard the appeal.
The remaining grounds of appeal.
22.
In addition to the three grounds of appeal considered above, Mr Barlow asked us to consider the written submissions that the appellant had lodged with the Criminal Appeal Office. Some of these submissions relate to the grounds upon which we were addressed by Mr Barlow. Some are new and different grounds; and we have focussed on these.
23.
First, the appellant seeks to argue that there was not sufficient evidence of sexual intercourse and absence of consent to go before the Jury. In our view there plainly was and the evidence was properly set out in the course of the summing up.
24.
Secondly, the appellant seeks to raise an argument that it was an error of law for the judge to direct the jury that a girl under 16 could not give her consent. We are not sure how this point arises since the judge said no more than ""age would be a factor in relation to consent"".
25.
Thirdly, the appellant raises the issue as to whether there was a proper direction as to the possibility that he might not have realised that the J was not consenting. In our view the summing-up on this point covered the issue properly. It was of course the appellant’s case that no sexual intercourse had occurred.
26.
Fourthly, the appellant argues that the introduction of J’s video evidence was impermissible under the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
. There is nothing in this point. This evidence was properly admitted under the provisions of the
Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999
.
27.
Fifthly, the appellant seeks to raise an argument based on the judge’s refusal to stay the prosecution as an abuse. We have considered the judge’s ruling on this point (made on 9
th
June). He rejected the application on the basis that, since the basis of the application related to the absence of defence exhibits, it was unlikely that the prosecution were under a duty to retain them and that, in any event, there was no prejudice or unfairness created by the absence of the exhibits. This ruling does not give rise to any arguable grounds of appeal.
28.
Sixthly, the appellant complains that his counsel did not explore with Lorna that she did not live at a particular address at the time the offences were said to have taken place at her house. In the absence of a waiver of privilege on this point, we are not satisfied that this gives rise to an arguable ground that the trial was unfair.
29.
Seventhly, there is a broad criticism that the judge was unfair to the appellant in his summary of the evidence. We do not accept that this is an arguable criticism of the judge. He had given the standard direction that the facts were for the Jury and correctly identified the nature of the defence, which included a reference to the difficulty which the appellant faced in dealing with allegations which were not precisely dated.
30.
Eighthly, the appellant submits that there was no sufficient evidence upon which the jury could properly convict him of particular counts which he has identified. Despite the detailed points which the appellant makes, we do not consider that this broad way of looking at the case adds anything to the arguments which we have already addressed and address below.
31.
The rest of the matters of complaint we can deal with more shortly: there was no misdirection in relation to the need for unanimity; questions which
might
have been put to J in the course of cross-examination do not give rise to arguable grounds; there was no requirement for a
Lucas
direction and the judge’s guidance to the jury on how they might approach the appellant’s evidence does not properly give rise to criticism; and there was no unfairness in the jury seeing an indictment in which one of the counts was not proceeded with.
Conclusion in relation to conviction.
32.
We therefore conclude that there is no substance in any of the grounds of appeal against conviction which have been drawn to our attention, and the appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
Sentence.
33.
As Mr Barlow submitted, the appellant is a man who prior to these events had no previous convictions, but the offences of which he was convicted were grave, and the sentence passed upon him had to reflect the aggravating circumstances of the case. It is not even contended that the sentence falls outside the range provided for in the guideline cases relevant to offences of this kind, and the renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence is therefore dismissed.","citation:

LADY JUSTICE HALLETT: This case is yet another sad example of what can happen when young people roam the streets of our cities vulnerable through drink and/or drugs. A 16 year old girl came to London to celebrate the New Year. She got drunk, she became separated from her friends and she ended up with strangers. She had sex with one of them. The defendant is accused of being that person. He is now in the charge of a jury on a single count of raping her, contrary to
section 1(1)
of The
Sexual Offences Act 2003
.
2.
At the close of the Crown's case, Mr Andrew Lewis, on behalf of the defendant, successfully made a submission of no case to answer before the trial judge, His Honour Judge McGregor-Johnson. The judge gave his reasons on 28th June 2007. The Crown Prosecution Service, represented by Miss Heather Norton, seeks to appeal the judge's ruling in accordance with
section 58
of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
. Given the fact that a jury remains empanelled, the application for leave has been expedited.
3.
It is necessary to rehearse in a little detail the prosecution evidence. On New Year's Eve 2005 the complainant, VR, and her two friends, BG and PK, traveled from their homes in the [an] area to central London. Some time between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the evening they met a friend. He drove them to Hayes, where they bought a bottle of wine and a litre of vodka. They also smoked some cannabis before boarding a train. The girls originally intended to get off at Westminster, but they continued to London Bridge, on their way consuming the alcohol they had bought. P drank the wine, V and B shared the litre of vodka.
4.
Having seen the New Year in, the girls made their way to Elephant and Castle, where they smoked some more cannabis. They then traveled by tube to various places, ending up at North Acton. By this time the complainant and her friend, B, had fallen out. V became separated from her friends. They got off the train at North Acton, but she continued, as she thought to White City.
5.
The complainant was very frank in her evidence about lapses in her memory. She had no recollections of her movements between Elephant and Castle and White City. She could not remember the argument with B. She could not remember becoming separated from her friends. Both P and B said that she was very drunk. B said she needed looking after. B also described her as stubborn and determined to get her own way.
6.
V got off the tube on her own at White City. She could recall the BBC building, cars and lights. On the opposite side of the road was a car containing three men, one of whom called her over. For some unknown reason, possibly problems with a former boyfriend, she got into the car. She sat in the back next to a man she described as Asian, said to be this defendant. The car drove off.
7.
In the course of the journey she said the man in the front passenger seat started “fingering” her, as in digital penetration. She said she did not know when this started or how it happened. She told the jury that the unknown man must have undone her jeans without her knowledge. All she could say was that when she saw his hand between her legs, she pulled it out, she did her trousers back up and told him to get off. His response was to laugh. She said she did not consent to what the man did.
8.
The prosecution case was that about ten minutes later the defendant asked her for sex. She described what happened in her video taped interview as follows:
""... I just remember the man in the back saying, 'Can I have sex?' but I can't remember what I said to him and all of a sudden my trousers were like yanked down and then he was like, he'd like pulled them down to my knee and then he just like pushed my legs forward and my like jeans were like covering my face and my nose, and he was just like having sex with me and I remember I couldn't breathe or anything.""
Later she said:
""I think I tried, I think I might have tried to say get off me but I don't think he could hear me because like the jeans was over my face and there was some music playing.""
9.
She confirmed in her evidence that she did not want to have sex with the man, that she did not think that she did so willingly and she did not think that she would have consented. She said she could not remember what she had said to the man because she was drunk. When pressed by Mr Lewis in cross-examination, she said she could not recall what she was thinking or saying. By using the word “consented” in this way, Miss Norton argued that it was clear that the complainant meant she could not say whether she had actually said ""yes"" or ""no"". Mr Lewis objected to this interpretation of the evidence. He argued that the complainant was clearly unable to exclude the possibility that she had said ""yes"" to sex.
10.
After the intercourse the complainant said that the man kept trying to kiss her, but she pushed him away and also said ""no"" when one of the men in the front of the car asked if it was his turn next. In due course the car stopped. The men invited her to go into a house, she refused and walked off crying. She saw a minicab and asked the driver for directions. He offered her a lift. Again, for some unknown reason, she accepted, and in the course of the drive the cab driver assaulted her and tried to kiss her. She rebuffed his advances. She subsequently told her friends what had happened. She was persuaded to go to the police.
11.
When examined by a doctor she was asked what happened and Mr Lewis asked us to highlight her response. The doctor said:
""She was unsure if the Indian male had raped her. She remembered having sex with him but she didn't remember if she gave her consent.""
12.
The complainant herself could not recall saying this. The defendant is Albanian, not Indian.
13.
The complainant’s clothes were examined and semen was found in the crotch area of her underwear. A full DNA profile was obtained. This matched the defendant. The chances of a matching profile being obtained from a man unrelated to him was estimated at 1 in 8 billion. The forensic scientist stated that this was a conservative estimate. Despite this, the defendant still insists that he was not the man who had intercourse with the complainant that night.
14.
The defendant was circulated as “wanted”. He was arrested on 31st December 2006. In interview, he denied any knowledge of the complainant and claimed that he had been in a nightclub in Enfield with a man called Tony all night. Clearly, if the jury accepted that it was his DNA in the underwear, then his account of being in Enfield was a lie.
15.
On behalf of the defence, Mr Lewis submitted to the trial judge that there was no case to answer because the Crown had not established that intercourse had taken place without consent. He argued that, firstly, the complainant clearly had capacity to consent because she had rejected the advances of the first and third man. Second, absent any issue about capacity, the only remaining issue was whether or not the complainant had, in fact, consented. Third, at its highest, the Crown's case was that she could not remember whether or not she had consented. As Mr Lewis put it to us, the Crown simply could not exclude the possibility that the complainant had said ""yes"".
16.
Miss Norton conceded at trial that she did not seek a conviction on the basis that consent had been withdrawn; she sought a conviction on the basis that consent had never been given. In response to the argument before us that the Crown could not exclude the possibility that the complainant had said ""yes"" and the Crown could not establish that the complainant had said ""no"", Miss Norton relied on cases such as
R v Malone
[1998] 2 Cr App R 447
, in which it was stated in clear terms:
""There is no requirement that the absence of consent has to be demonstrated or that it has to be communicated to the defendant for the actus reus of rape to exist.""
Further in the judgment it is said:
""It is not the law that the prosecution in order to obtain a conviction for rape have to show that the complainant was either incapable of saying no or putting up some physical resistance, or did say no or put up some physical resistance.""
17.
This statement of principle, Miss Norton argued, supported her contention that the Crown does not need to establish that the complainant said ""no"" to the defendant, or that the complainant had not said ""yes"".
18.
She submitted the issue here was simply whether or not there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the complainant did not consent. She argued there was ample evidence to that effect. The complainant said she did not consent to sex when she got in the car and she did not consent to the fingering of her by the male in the front seat. Thereafter the alleged rapist (a man she had only just met) yanked her clothes down suddenly and pushed her into position. She had said that she did not think that she would have consented to intercourse in these circumstances. She also suggested that she may have told the man to get off her because she did not want to have sex with him. When he tried to kiss her, she pushed him away and she did not think she would have taken part in sex willingly. Miss Norton also reminded us that she cried as she left the scene. She said that she felt disgusted with herself and she did not think she would have just gone along with sex.
19.
Miss Norton argued further that even if the complainant had said ""yes"" to intercourse - which, on the facts of this case, she maintained was highly implausible - there remained an issue as to whether or not she had the capacity to consent. There was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that she did not have such capacity. She is a small girl, just 5 foot 3 in height, weighing 8 stone 3 pounds, aged 16, who on any view had consumed half a litre of vodka and smoked cannabis prior to the incident. She was described as very drunk and in need of being looked after. Miss Norton reminded us she could not remember details of her journey and some of what happened when she was sitting in the car. She also had little recollection of the subsequent assault at the hands of the minicab driver.
20.
Despite objection from Mr Lewis, Miss Norton also attempted to rely upon the fact that the jury could find the defendant had lied about having sex with the complainant that night. At trial she conceded - and, by the sounds of it, immediately regretted the concession - that any lies told by the defendant would only be relevant to his state of mind and whether he reasonably believed that the complainant was consenting. She now seeks to withdraw that concession. She argues that if the defendant did lie and he was the man who had sex with the complainant, his lie could well go to the issue of consent and capacity to consent. If the defendant lied about his knowledge and involvement because he did not reasonably believe that V was either consenting or had capacity to consent, she argued that would be cogent evidence to be taken into account in deciding whether she in fact consented or had the capacity to consent. If the defendant was the man, his knowledge and/or belief would be highly material evidence.
21.
Mr Lewis argued that the complainant herself did not assert that she lacked the capacity to consent; she simply suggested that she had gaps in her memory. He maintained that her evidence supported his contention that she was able to withhold consent, for example from the first man and the minicab driver. Further, he argued that she had a good memory of some of the detail of that night, for example what she saw when she got out at White City and some of the detail of what went on as she got into the car.
22.
The judge, in his ruling, observed that, at its highest, the complainant's evidence was that she did not think she would have consented. He stated that the prosecution accepted the complainant could not say that she did not say ""yes"". He moved immediately from the issue of whether or not she had consented to the issue of whether there was evidence that she lacked the capacity to agree by choice as a result of taking drink and drugs. He stated that he took into account the decision in
R v Bree
[2007] EWCA Crim 804
. He found that although there was evidence of drunkenness, it was insufficient to allow a jury safely to conclude that the complainant had lacked the capacity to consent. He pointed to evidence which supported the defence submission that immediately before and after intercourse the complainant had demonstrated a capacity to agree or disagree by choice. He also referred to the evidence of the complainant's friends that although they said she was very drunk, they also said she was capable of expressing herself clearly, being stubborn and insisting on doing what she wanted.
23.
Miss Norton placed some reliance upon the decision in
Bree
, to which the judge referred. She placed reliance upon it in general, but she also placed reliance upon it in particular insofar as the President, in giving the judgment of the court, referred to the well publicised case of
R v Dougal
heard at the Swansea Crown Court. This was a case in which the prosecution offered no further evidence where the complainant could not remember giving or withholding her consent. At paragraph 32 of
Bree
, the court observed:
""Without knowing all the details of the case, and focusing exclusively on the observations of counsel for the Crown in
Dougal
, it would be open to question whether the inability of the complainant to remember whether she gave her consent or not might on further reflection be approached rather differently. Prosecuting counsel may wish he had expressed himself more felicitously.""
24.
Bree
was a case, Miss Norton reminded us, in which the complainant had not said ""no"" to intercourse with the defendant. She had a patchy recollection of events and she could not say whether or not she was responding to the defendant's advances.
25.
In
Bree
the observations of the court in
R v Lang
[1976] 62 Cr App R 50
are quoted with approval. In a case of rape where there was evidence of drink and the issue was consent, ""the critical question is not how she came to take the drink, but whether she understood her situation and was capable of making up her mind… [attention should have been focused upon] the state of her understanding and her capacity to express judgment in the circumstances"". This principle was emphasised in
Bree
, where the court held:
""... as a matter of practical reality, capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. Whether this is so or not, however, is fact specific, or more accurately, depends on the actual state of mind of the individuals involved on the particular occasion.""
26.
Before stating our conclusions, it is worth noting our powers. Under
section 61(1)
of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
this court has power to confirm, reverse or vary any ruling to which the appeal relates. Section 67 provides:
""The Court of Appeal may not reverse a ruling on an appeal under this Part unless it is satisfied -
that the ruling was wrong in law,
that the ruling involved an error of law or principle, or
that the ruling was a ruling that it was not reasonable for the judge to have made.""
27.
In the time available for argument, we have been asked to approach this case simply on the basis that it is section 67(c) which applies here.
28.
In most cases this court will take some persuading to exercise its powers under
section 61(1)
to reverse a ruling made by a trial judge based on his assessment of the evidence. He will have had the inestimable advantage of having seen the witnesses give their evidence and having heard their evidence being tested. A trial judge will usually be in a far better position than this court to assess the strength of the evidence at the close of the Crown’s case. Unusually, however, this is a case where the Court of Appeal is in a relatively good position to judge whether or not the case should have been left to the jury. We have a full transcript of the complainant's video-taped interview and we have a transcript of her evidence. It is also common ground that the complainant appears to have been a honest witness, doing her best to recall what had happened, and was unusually frank. Thus, her credibility is not in issue and her reaction to questioning is of limited significance.
29.
We must focus on the evidence called before the jury to prove the following four issues:
whether sexual intercourse took place between the defendant and the complainant;
ii. whether the complainant in fact consented to intercourse;
iii whether the complainant had the freedom and capacity to consent; and,
iv. whether the defendant reasonably believed that she consented.
30.
Given the DNA evidence, the jury may have little difficulty with the first question - that is not a matter for us. As to the next three questions, whatever concessions made by Miss Norton in the heat of argument, in our judgment the jury would be entitled, as a matter of law, to bear in mind any lies, if that is what the jury find them to be, told by the defendant as to whether or not he had sex with the complainant on the night in question. If the jury decided he lied because he knew the complainant was too drunk to consent or knew that she in fact did not consent, that would undoubtedly help them in their task of assessing whether he raped her. He was better placed than anyone, if he was the man concerned, to form a view as to the complainant's condition and attitude.
31.
We are satisfied on our review of the evidence, helpfully summarised by Miss Norton and by Mr Lewis that, with respect to the very experienced judge, there is here sufficient evidence of rape to be left to the jury. As was pointed out in argument, whatever progress Mr Lewis had undoubtedly made in cross-examination, in re-examination the complainant insisted she did not want to have sex when she got into the car, she did not want to have sex when she found the clothing on her face and she told the man to get off during the course of intercourse. The fact that she did not say ""no"" at the moment of initial penetration is not, in our judgment, fatal to the prosecution case.
32.
We are satisfied that this was a ruling that it was not reasonable to make within the meaning of section 67. The judge has erred, in our view, by trespassing too far into the jury's territory by withdrawing the case from them. It was for the jury, not the judge, to decide, on the basis of the evidence called, whether, on these facts, in this case, the complainant had the capacity to consent and/or in fact consented to intercourse or not.
33.
To our mind, despite Mr Lewis' eloquent efforts, his submissions are based to a large extent on the premise that because the complainant cannot remember if she consented or not, that is fatal to the prosecution. This principle, if it is such, was expressly disavowed by this court in
Bree
: see paragraphs 30 to 32. As Miss Norton observed, Mr Lewis' arguments are all good jury points. No doubt they will be deployed to great effect in his closing speech, but in our judgment that is exactly where they should be deployed. This is pre-eminently a case for a jury.
34.
Issues of consent and capacity to consent to intercourse in cases of alleged rape should normally be left to the jury to determine. It would be a rare case indeed where it would be appropriate for a judge to stop a case in which, on one view, a 16 year old girl, alone at night and vulnerable through drink, is picked up by a stranger who has sex with her within minutes of meeting her and she says repeatedly she would not have consented to sex in these circumstances.
35.
Accordingly, we give the Crown Prosecution Service leave to appeal the ruling and we allow the appeal. The ruling is quashed. The case will be remitted to the Crown Court for the trial to continue as soon as possible.
36.
We understand that the judge has sensibly made arrangements for the jury to be contacted so that they can resume the trial as soon as possible, and we note - and are delighted to note - that the judge was very careful in giving his ruling and telling the jury they must go away for a short time, not to give them any hint of what was afoot. They can therefore resume this trial blissfully ignorant of the judge's ruling and this appeal.
37.
Given this matter is going back for trial, the reporting restrictions must stay in place. There must be no reporting of this case until the trial is concluded.
38.
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT: Mr Lewis, Miss Norton, thank you for your efforts. You last were doing this trial on 28th June. What is the prognosis? When are you expected to resume as you now have to?
39.
MISS NORTON: Tomorrow.
40.
MR LEWIS: The judge indicated to the jury that the court would contact them today and they would try to resume tomorrow morning.
41.
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT: Good.
42.
MR LEWIS: That is the plan.
43.
LADY JUSTICE HALLETT: Thank you both very much.","citation:

Mr J Farmer
appeared on behalf of the
Applicant
J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE TREACY:
2.
This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence after refusal by the single judge.
3.
The applicant pleaded guilty on 14th January 2014 at Norwich Crown Court to an offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. That is an offence contrary to
section 1
A of the
Road Traffic Act 1988
. This provision came into force in November 2012. The reference to serious injury is to physical harm which amounts to grievous bodily harm for the purposes of the Offences Against the Person Act.
4.
In addition, the applicant admitted driving with excess alcohol which had been committed to the Crown Court under the provisions of section 41.
5.
On 7th February 2014 he was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment for the dangerous driving offence, with four months concurrent for the excess alcohol. He was disqualified from driving for three years and until an extended test is passed.
6.
The offence took place at about 8 am on Saturday 20th April 2013. The road concerned is a B road in a rural or semi-rural area. The applicant had been out all night at pubs or clubs or otherwise socialising. He had been drinking and was subsequently found to be one-and-a-half times the legal limit. In addition, blood analysis showed the presence of ecstasy, amphetamine and cannabis.
7.
At the time of the accident the applicant was driving his car with three passengers. The site of the accident was at a humpback bridge which had a straight approach to it. The applicant was driving fast as he approached the bridge. At least one passenger told him to slow down. The applicant in fact increased speed as he approached the bridge and made comments showing that he intended to take the bridge at speed. He ignored further warnings to slow down.
8.
The vehicle took off on the humpback bridge and when it regained contact with the road the applicant lost control and the vehicle somersaulted off the road before coming to rest in a field.
9.
There had been three bystanders who had witnessed the accident. It was obvious to them what was going to happen. Two of them estimated the applicant's speed as being in the region of 80 mph. Another put it at well in excess of 50 mph.
10.
The consequences for those in the vehicle were very severe but luckily not fatal. Amber Read, a female rear seat passenger who had to be freed from the vehicle by emergency services, sustained a brain haemorrhage, bilateral contusions of the lungs, several fractures of the thoracic spine with bleeding around the spine and heart. There was a large wound to her scalp which required stitching. Following surgery to her back, she has been left with rods permanently inserted. These are visible and have resulted in scarring. In addition, there were fractures of her clavicle and chest bones.
11.
Joseph Cork had one fractured and three crushed vertebrae and a fractured spine. He also had cuts to his head and both hands. Jason Chapman had an injury to his right shoulder blade and lost an area from his scalp which required stitching. He suffered back spasms for several weeks.
12.
All three of the passengers suffered continuing consequences from their injuries by the time of sentence, which was some nine months after the accident. Their victim statements show continuing pain, together with employment and psychological problems.
13.
The applicant himself was seriously injured. He suffered a fractured skull and a brain haemorrhage, a fractured jaw requiring plating and a fractured arm.
14.
There are matters about the applicant's previous history and/or background which are relevant. In 2006 when he was 14 he was convicted of dangerous driving. In the same year when he was 15 he was convicted of aggravated vehicle taking. By the time of this accident he had nine points on his licence. In 2010 he had used a mobile phone whilst driving and in 2012 he had used a vehicle without insurance.
15.
There was evidence that he had been using his mobile phone on the journey which led to this accident, albeit not in the immediate run up to it.
16.
His record also shows convictions for battery in 2009 and being drunk and disorderly in 2012. Both of those offences are drink related. There is also a 2012 conviction for possession of a class A drug.
17.
On the other side of the coin, the applicant had a satisfactory work record and some favourable character references. Given the location of the accident the road in question was not likely to be heavily used, although the applicant had no means of knowing what lay on the other side of a steep humpback bridge.
18.
For the applicant it is submitted that this was not a sustained piece of dangerous driving. Whilst the level of alcohol was unlawful it was not excessive and whilst the injuries caused to two of the passengers could be described as involving serious physical injury, it was possible to imagine cases where non-fatal catastrophic injury might be caused.
19.
Accordingly, it was submitted by Mr Farmer that this was not the most serious case of its kind and that a starting point of four years and six months, which is close to the maximum of five years, was wrong in principle.
20.
This relatively new offence reflected a decision by Parliament to meet a gap identified by both in judgments of this court and in public concern between the maximum sentence of two years for dangerous driving and the maximum sentence of 14 years for causing death by dangerous driving. It had been felt for many years that legislation failed to provide for circumstances in which not only had the driving been of a character likely to cause injury to life and limb, but had actually caused serious and significant injury to others. The result has been this new offence carrying a maximum of five years.
21.
There is of course no sentencing guideline in place for this offence. However, there is a guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines Council relating to causing death by dangerous driving. We think it helpful to have regard to that guideline in relation to the levels of offending identified there.
22.
The least serious, Level 3, is driving creating a significant risk of danger. Examples given are of driving above the speed limit, driving when deprived of adequate sleep or rest, a brief but obvious danger arising from a seriously dangerous manoeuvre and driving whilst avoidably distracted.
23.
Level 2 is described as driving that created a substantial risk of danger. Examples given are greatly excessive speed, gross avoidable distraction such as reading or texting over a period of time, and driving whilst impaired as a result of alcohol or drugs.
24.
Level 1 is described as covering the most serious offences, encompassing driving that involves a deliberate decision to ignore (or a flagrant disregard for) the rules of the road and an apparent disregard for the great danger being caused to others. Examples given are a prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of very bad driving, the consumption of substantial amounts of alcohol or drugs leading to gross impairment, or a group of factors which in smaller number would place the offence in Level 2.
25.
The guideline recognises that the presence of aggravating factors or examples of seriousness will increase the starting point within a sentence range and may justify moving to the next level of seriousness.
26.
Given the level of the statutory maximum for the
section 1
A offence compared to that for the simple offence of dangerous driving, there will of necessity be a degree of compression in the sentences available to the court to reflect different types of dangerous driving and its consequences in the
section 1
A offence.
27.
It seems to us therefore that it is not a helpful exercise to indulge in considering the very worst imaginable type of case which would attract a sentence at the maximum. A more realistic approach is to identify a broader band of conduct which will represent the most serious offending within the ambit of the offence.
28.
It seems to us that whilst it might be arguable that the applicant's dangerous driving falls into the upper ranges of Level 2 rather than within Level 1, given the absence of prolonged very bad driving and gross impairment through the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs, the fact remains that this applicant did take a deliberate decision to ignore the rules of road safety in circumstances which inevitably caused very considerable danger to others. There may be a respectable argument that the driving did indeed fall within Level 1.
29.
However, even if the driving falls within the upper ranges of Level 2, there are a number of important aggravating factors. First, previous convictions for motoring offences, especially those involving bad driving. Secondly, and importantly in the context of an offence predicated upon the causing of serious injury to another, two of the passengers were seriously injured with continuing consequences for them and a third was significantly injured.
30.
Moreover, the offence was committed whilst the ability to drive was impaired not only by drink, but also by the consumption of drugs in circumstances where the offender had been up all night.
31.
In addition, the applicant had ignored warnings that he should moderate his speed and had responded to them by doing the very opposite. He accelerated harder as he approached the humpback bridge. This was deliberate risk-taking at high speed in very dangerous circumstances. We regard the culpability of the applicant in those circumstances as being extremely high, and within the context of this offence the harm done by his actions is again very high.
32.
In those circumstances, we consider that the judge was entitled to regard this offence as falling within the range of the most serious offences of this kind. Although the starting point of four years and six months was undoubtedly severe, we consider that it was deservedly severe. The judge then made some allowance for the applicant's personal mitigation and full allowance for early guilty pleas.
33.
In the circumstances the resultant sentence and disqualification were not manifestly excessive and this renewed application is refused.","citation:

JUDGMENT
Lord Justice Potter:
1.
This is an application by the Attorney General for the leave of the Court under
s.36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988
to refer a sentence said to be unduly lenient. We grant leave.
2.
The name of the offender is Leon Mark Jameson, aged 22 years, having been born on 23 May 1981. At the time of the offences he was 21 years old.
3.
The offender faced an indictment containing nine counts. Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 alleged Theft. Counts 2 and 9 alleged Robbery and Count 6 was an allegation of Attempted Robbery. On 15 July 2003 the offender appeared in the Hull Crown Court before Miss Recorder Bond and pleaded guilty to all Counts on the indictment with the exception of Count 5 on which no evidence was offered and a ‘not guilty’ verdict entered. The offender had also pleaded guilty to breaching the requirements of a Community Rehabilitation Order which had been imposed at Hull Crown Court on 20 December 2002 in respect of two offences, namely theft and having an offensive weapon.
4.
The offender was sentenced as follows.
i)
Count 1: Theft of a car – 12 months’ imprisonment.
ii)
Count 2: Robbery – 30 months’ imprisonment consecutive to Count 1.
iii)
Count 3: Theft of a till – 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
iv)
Count 4:Theft of a car - 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
v)
Count 6: Attempted Robbery – 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
vi)
Count 7: Theft of a handbag – 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
vii)
Count 8: Theft of a car – 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
viii)
Count 9: Robbery – 30 months’ imprisonment concurrent.
5.
In respect of the two previous matters which fell to be resentenced, the offender was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on each to run concurrently rather than consecutively. Thus, he was sentenced to a total of 3 years 6 months imprisonment.
6.
In short summary, the offender, assisted by others, embarked on a crime spree of considerable intensity over a two-day period. Eight separate offences were committed in quick succession. They involved theft of two motor vehicles which were in turn used to facilitate the commission of thefts and robberies at small, unprotected retail premises and on vulnerable members of the public. The facts underlying the various counts were as follows.
7.
Late on the night of Tuesday 25 March 2003 or very early on the following morning, a Rover Maestro car was stolen from outside its owner’s address. (Count 1)
8.
At 7.35pm on Wednesday 26 March, the offender was seen to be driving the same Rover car in which he had a male passenger. It pulled up near an off-licence. Both men got out of the car, leaving the engine running with the headlights switched off. They entered the off-licence. The offender approached the counter and asked the assistant for some cigarettes. As she turned her back, the offender leaned over the counter and grabbed the till. The assistant tried to prevent this and, in the course of doing so, sustained bruising to her arm. She said that the offender looked so determined and aggressive that she decided not to resist him further. The offender got hold of the bottom part of the till containing the cash drawer and he and his accomplice ran from the shop. They got into the car and drove off. The till contained approximately £60 in cash. (Count 2)
9.
About 1½ hours later at about 9.00pm, a shop assistant in a fish and chip shop was tidying up. She heard a loud crashing sound from the front counter which she immediately recognised as the till being violently forced from it. She looked up and saw the offender leaning over the counter with his outstretched arms holding the till. He brought the till up to his chest and turned and ran out of the shop. He was seen to run to a waiting Rover Maestro car, the headlights of which had been turned off. The offender jumped into the open passenger door and the car was driven off at speed by an accomplice. The till contained over £100 in cash. (Count 3)
10.
Early on the morning of the next day, 27 March 2003, a silver Ford Escort car was stolen from outside its owner’s home address. It had been alarmed and immobilised prior to its theft. (Count 4)
11.
At about 8.45am, Christine Cook was cycling along Chanterlands Avenue in Hull when she passed a stationary silver car with at least three occupants. It was in fact the stolen Ford Escort. The car then drove past her. As she turned into Barrington Avenue, there were cars parked on both sides of the road. She was suddenly aware of the silver car being alongside her only inches away to her right. The front passenger door opened and a man’s hand reached out towards her black leather shoulder bag which was wrapped round the handlebars. He was unable to remove the bag but retained hold of it and the victim found herself being pulled along by the speed of the car and no longer in control of her bicycle. Her bicycle collided with a parked vehicle and she fell sideways, at which point the man let go of the bag and the car sped off. She fell into the roadway and slid along the tarmac, suffering a dull intense pain in her right cheek, the right side of the bridge of her nose and the right-hand side of her head. She suffered bruising, rather than bony injury, but was very frightened, not least because she was a sufferer from osteoporosis. The offender’s palm print was later found on the driver’s rear view mirror. (Count 6)
12.
Only minutes later, Julie Hossack had parked her car in a car park at Ellerburn Avenue, Hull at approximately 9.00am. She was sitting in the car with her handbag on the front passenger seat when she saw the offender walking towards her. He walked past the front of the car out of her sight, but then came back towards the car and she thought from his actions that he was asking her for the time. She told him and he appeared to walk off again. About a minute later she was aware of the front passenger door being opened and she saw the offender reach in and take the bag. He ran off. She gave chase and, as she turned the corner, she saw the silver Ford car driving off at speed. A witness saw what occurred and recognised the offender, whose mother she knew. (Count 7)
13.
That same morning a white Ford Orion belonging to a Mr David Owston was stolen. It had been secured with a steering lock on the wheel prior to its theft. (Count 8)
14.
At about 1.30pm on the same day, staff were working in a newsagent’s shop at 262 Greenwood Avenue, Hull. A female assistant noticed a man going up to the shop window and saying to another man “They have got some here.” The offender then entered the shop and walked to the counter. The second man entered the store but remained at the doorway, holding it open. The offender selected some chewing gum and the assistant scanned it through the till. The second man walked up to the counter and told the offender to get him some cigarettes. As the assistant turned to get the cigarettes, the offender grabbed for the till. He was unsuccessful and made a grab for a second till next to it. A struggle ensued over the till. During the struggle, the second man grabbed a large quantity of scratch cards from a nearby display and left the shop. Eventually the offender managed to grab the cash draw containing £360 and left the shop. The robbery was captured on CCTV and the offender was identified. (Count 9)
15.
On 1 April 2003, following a search of an address on a north Hull estate, the offender was arrested. He was later interviewed about the offences and made no comment to all questions asked of him. However, he subsequently decided to plead guilty to the eight offences we have described.
16.
Counsel for the Attorney General has submitted that the following aggravating features are present in respect of these offences. First, they formed part of a concerted course of criminality, albeit over a short time period. Second, motor vehicles were stolen to facilitate the commission of the robberies, indicating a degree of premeditation and planning. Third, the offender appeared specifically to have targeted vulnerable premises and vulnerable victims. Fourth, the execution of the attempted robbery, the subject of count 6, while not involving use of a weapon, showed a total disregard for the safety of the victim who could have been killed or sustained serious injury as a result of being dragged along on her bicycle by the moving motor vehicle. Fifth, the offences were committed during the currency of an 18-month Community Rehabilitation Order with conditions imposed only three months earlier. The offences in question were theft from a car after smashing its window, and possession of a lock knife which was produced and brandished in the course of an argument with two others. Finally, the offender has a bad record for offences of this nature and has served a number of short custodial sentences since he was 16 years of age. His longest custodial sentence had been one of 9 months imposed in October 2001 for two offences of theft and one of handling stolen goods committed while on bail.
17.
On the other hand, the following mitigating features appear to be present. First, the offender pleaded guilty, indicating an early intention to plead guilty to all of the counts mentioned save count 6. Second, little or no violence was used in the commission of the robberies. There was however an element of recklessness and considerable danger in the circumstances relating to count 6. Finally, no weapons were carried and there were no significant attempts to disguise the appearance of the offender or his accomplices.
18.
Counsel for the Attorney General has submitted that, in passing sentence, the judge must have paid insufficient attention to the aggravating features which we have outlined. He submits that the sentence imposed was one which might have been appropriate to a single count of robbery without undue violence or use of weapons but that, in the case of a concerted course of conduct involving a number of offences by an offender with the bad criminal record of this offender, and committed only a few months into an 18-month Community Rehabilitation Order, the sentence was unduly lenient. He submits that the judge was correct to impose sentences on Counts 2 - 9 which were consecutive to the original theft of the Rover Maestro which appears to have triggered and facilitated the two-day course of conduct which followed. However, he submits that the sentences imposed for the totality of the subsequent offences (which were all concurrent and none of which exceeded 30 months’ imprisonment), were inadequate. In particular, he submits that the attempted robbery, the subject of Count 6 was the most serious and dangerous of the offences and merited substantially more than 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent. Counsel submits that, in the light of the dangerous course of conduct, the frightening effect of the injury upon the victim and the avoidance of serious injury only by chance, a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment on Count 6 would have been appropriate. Finally, he submits that the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent for a breach of the requirements of the Community Rehabilitation Order was wrong in principle and that a consecutive sentence should have been imposed in that respect, so as to yield a total period of 6 years’ imprisonment.
19.
The Attorney General has referred us to four particular authorities as follows.
20.
In
Attorney General’s Reference No.9 of 1989 (Steven Lloyd Lacy)
[1990] 12 Crim App R (S) 7, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment imposed on a defendant who pleaded guilty having participated in a sub-post office robbery, was increased to one of 5 years without reference being made to a discount for double jeopardy. The offender had no previous convictions, but the level of violence in the robbery was high and the court emphasised the need, following
Attorney General’s Reference No.2 of 1989 (Darren Mark Major)
[1989] 11 Crim App R (S) 481, to incorporate a deterrent element in respect of robberies which target small shops particularly susceptible to attack.
21.
In
Attorney General’s Reference No.58 of 1996 (Karl David Jones)
[1997] 2 Crim App R (S) 233, the court stated that the normal level of sentence in respect of robbery or attempted robbery of an off-licence was 3-7 years, depending upon the mitigating and aggravating features and, in particular, the level of violence used. That case was not dissimilar from the one before us in the sense that the offender, aged 22, had a fairly similar criminal record to the offender in this case. The level of violence involved was somewhat greater than in the instant case but, whereas the defendant also pleaded to four other counts of theft, there was no other charge of robbery involved. The court made clear that the sentence of 18 months imposed by the judge wholly failed to reflect the gravity of the offence and substituted a sentence of 3½ years after taking into account double jeopardy and the imminence of the offender’s release. It did not make clear what it considered would have been the appropriate sentence absent those considerations, but we surmise it would have been one of 4½-5 years.
22.
In
Attorney General’s Reference Nos.4 and 7 of 2000 (Adrian Michael Lobban, Christopher Sawyers; Steven James Cue)
[2002] Crim App R (S) 345, this court gave general guidance in respect of the prevalent crime of street robbery of mobile telephones, in respect of which a robust sentencing policy was advocated within the bracket 18 months to 5 years, with an upper limit of 3 years where no weapon was involved. In that case the position of the offender Sawyers was most readily comparable to that of the offender in this case. The court indicated an appropriate level of sentence of 4 years in the case of a 19 year-old offender who had pleaded guilty to three charges of robbery and two of theft.
23.
Finally, we were referred to an authority on which the Attorney General has placed particular reliance as justifying a substantially more severe approach than that indicated in the authorities so far cited. In
R v Greenland
[2003] 1 Crim App R (S) 375, EWCA Crim 1748, this court upheld a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment imposed upon the perpetrator of a violent handbag robbery by a defendant who had lain in wait for a woman victim walking home across a common. He appears to have had previous convictions for robbery in the course of a criminal career comparable to, but somewhat longer and more serious than, this offender and with a longer history of drug abuse. The major distinguishing feature would appear to be the high level of violence used, the victim having been repeatedly punched in the face when she resisted. The court observed:
“This kind of street robbery is prevalent and becoming increasingly so. Such robberies are serious and this is a particularly serious example. People are entitled to be safe and feel safe on the streets and to know that the courts will do their best to ensure their safety. This kind of conduct merits condign punishment.”
24.
We would certainly endorse that final observation. However, we note that, in this case, the method of the offender has been essentially one in which violence has been avoided or minimised and we do not derive particular assistance from the approach in
Greenland
, where the court was in any event concerned with the question whether 6 years was “manifestly excessive”, as opposed to the Attorney General’s references to which we have earlier referred and which afford better grounds for comparison.
25.
Having carefully considered the matter, we are of the view that the offender was substantially under-sentenced in this case. We accept the submission for the Attorney General that, bearing in mind the principle of totality and the breach of the requirements of the Community Rehabilitation Order, an appropriate total sentence upon a plea of guilty was one of 6 years’ imprisonment. However, bearing in mind the element of double jeopardy we think it appropriate to substitute a total sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment. To achieve that result, we quash the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment concurrent imposed upon Count 6 and substitute therefor a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment to run consecutively to the 12 months’ sentence on Count 1, but concurrently with the other sentences.","citation:

1.
MR JUSTICE SILBER: Matthew Blyth appeals with leave of the single judge against sentences totalling 12 months' imprisonment, which have been imposed upon him at the Crown Court at Canterbury on 27th July 2009. The appellant had earlier pleaded guilty to counts of common assault and on rearraignment to an offence of dangerous driving. He received a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment for the dangerous driving and 4 months' imprisonment concurrent for the common assault.
2.
The appeal relates to an offence which occurred on 30th October 2000 and when a parking warden, Mr Dean Altridge, was on duty in uniform in Dover. The time came when a Subaru motorcar owned by the appellant was parked in an area where loading was not permitted. Mr Altridge noted there was nobody in it and then started to issue a penalty notice when the appellant arrived carrying some carrier bags shouting that he was going.
3.
The appellant then got into his car and reversed back several feet before winding down the window and asking Mr Altridge if he was going to give him a parking ticket. At that time Mr Altridge was taking a picture of the car and he replied in the affirmative whereupon he printed off the ticket and handed it to the appellant who had been argumentative. The appellant put the steering full lock to the right and the car lurched towards Mr Altridge who had to quickly step out of the way to avoid being hit. Mr Altridge moved to the rear of the car and again moved quickly out of the way as the appellant reversed towards him. Indeed Mr Altridge reached a point where there was a metal pollard between him and the car. At this point, the appellant got out of the car and approached Mr Altridge saying ""shall we take this round the corner"". The appellant put his hands on Mr Altridge shoulders and pushed him hard enough that Mr Altridge had to take a step back. A bystander shouted there was closed circuit television at which point the appellant got back into his car and drove off.
4.
There was a basis of plea put forward and the appellant accepted his guilt to dangerous driving but he did so on the basis ""that he reversed in the heat of the moment, over a short distance towards in the direction of the traffic warden thereby exposing him to the risk of injury."" The basis of plea stated ""at no stage did he drive deliberately at a traffic warden nor was it his intention to cause the traffic warden any harm or injury"".
5.
There was an impact statement from Mr Altridge, who explained he was so upset by what had happened that it affected his sleeping. He was also signed off work for a period of four weeks but he subsequently returned to work with the benefit of counselling.
6.
The appellant is now aged 36 years of age. He has 12 convictions for 21 offences and he served a number of custodial sentences mainly for drug offences.
7.
In January 2003 he received a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
8.
The pre-sentence report noted that the appellant attributed his behaviour to his agitated state and his own stupidity in parking illegally and what he perceived as overzealous officiousness. The judge in sentencing the appellant explained that the car had been used as a weapon.
9.
The basis of the plea is that the sentence was manifestly excessive and that the judge went behind the basis of plea which had not been challenged by the prosecution.
10.
We have no doubt that a custodial sentence in this case was totally justified. Car parking attendants perform a useful function and also the nature of their work means they are subject to regular abuse and vilification. Set against that background, there is a need to give them protection and to give sentences which deter people from behaving in an aggressive way towards them.
11.
The behaviour of the appellant in this case, the public case, merits custodial sentence. But the issue then is whether or not the sentence was too long. In the advice accompanying the notice of appeal counsel referred first to the decision of this court in
R v Fabian Robert Joseph
[2001] EWCA Crim 1195
, in which a motorist who dissatisfied that at receiving a parking ticket got into his vehicle and turned his vehicle towards the parking attendant and drove at him. In consequence the attendant slid onto the bonnet of the vehicle and carrying 150 yards down the road before he got off the vehicle and the appellant drove off. The attendant received a cut finger and some pain in his back. He did not require hospital treatment. An independent witness had seen the vehicle driven by the appellant with the traffic warden on the bonnet and he noted that the appellant's car was weaving and appeared to be accelerating at the same time. The appellant in that case was convicted after pleading not guilty. He was a man of previous good character, whose business had gone into bankruptcy. The sentence was reduced by this court from 15 months' imprisonment to 10 months' imprisonment.
12.
Another case relied on by the appellant's counsel is
R v Watson
[2007] EWCA Crim 1595
, in which a parking attendant had issued a ticket when the driver returned to the car and chased the traffic warden up the road and threw a stone at him. The driver threatened to ""burst his arse"" and he said that if he saw the parking warden again he would run him over. When the traffic warden went down the street and started to make some notes, the driver got into his car and executed a three-point turn. He then drove deliberately at the attendant. The driving of the appellant in that case was described as being very aggressive, with the driver speeding up the car and deliberately swerving towards the parking warden who was forced to jump out of the way. There was another incident a few minutes later when the car returned and drove towards the traffic warden, but he was not hit. The appellant pleaded not guilty but after conviction he was sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment. On appeal this court reduced his sentence to 12 months' imprisonment.
13.
Of course neither of those cases are guideline cases and each case depends on their particular facts. We do note that in this case, as compared with the other cases, the appellant had a bad record but, on the other hand, the degree of violence shown by him was far less. We also consider that the judge went behind the basis of plea in finding that the car had been used as a form of weapon.
14.
In our view, the appropriate sentence in this case would have been 12 months' imprisonment but, after applying the conventional discount for an early plea, the appropriate sentence should be 8 months' imprisonment. To that extent we reduce the sentence of dangerous driving to 8 months' imprisonment. The overall sentence therefore becomes 8 months' imprisonment. To that extent this appeal is allowed.","citation:

Judgment
Friday 29 February 2008
LORD JUSTICE DYSON:
I will ask Mr Justice Maddison to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE MADDISON:
1. On 26 July 2007, in the Central Criminal Court, the applicant, Courtney Daley, was convicted of manslaughter by way of provocation as an alternative to the single count of murder with which he was indicted. On 23 August he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Van Der Werff to nine years' detention in a young offender institution. He renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge.
2. The relevant circumstances were that the victim, who was 18 at the time of his death, had first had contact with the applicant, who was 17 at the time of the offence, in November 2005 at the College of North East London, where both had been involved in violent clashes between their opposing groups of friends.
3. At just after midnight on 9 January 2007 the victim was speaking to his girlfriend on the telephone. He was walking home from an evening out with friends. He was a few houses away from his own address in Broadwater Road, Tottenham. He cut the call short because the applicant had caught his attention and it appeared had called out to him. A neighbour saw them facing each other but was not able to see exactly what happened next. Accordingly, there was no independent evidence as to the circumstances in which the violent incident between the two young men began. However, there was clear evidence that shortly after that incident the victim staggered home and collapsed outside. He had been fatally stabbed to the chest by the applicant. The applicant was chased by the victim's father and caught by police officers who were in the vicinity. The applicant had discarded a lock-knife which was found in a nearby garden.
4. The victim was treated at the scene and taken to the North Middlesex Hospital. He died at 1am. He had sustained several stab wounds, some superficial, but including two principal wounds to the chest, one of which had been inflicted with sufficient force to cut a rib and to penetrate his heart. The jury's verdict was on the basis that there was present the mental element sufficient for the crime of murder, but provocation of a degree sufficient to reduce that crime to one of manslaughter.
5. In interview the applicant declined to answer any questions, but provided a prepared statement. He said that he had been walking along Broadwater Road and had seen the victim of his offence walking in front of him. The victim had turned around and confronted the applicant and then head-butted the applicant to the nose, before grabbing hold of him and attempting to punch him. At that point the applicant had taken out the knife that he carried for defensive purposes and had swung at the victim in order to dissuade him from pursuing the assault. The applicant said that he did not intend to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. That was plainly rejected by the jury. At the trial, as we understand it, the defences of provocation and self-defence were put before the jury.
6. The applicant at the date of his conviction was 18. He was of previous good character. The judge had a pre-sentence report which stated that the applicant's approach was still to place much of the blame on the deceased. Although the applicant attempted to express remorse, the author of the report considered that that remorse and regret had more to do with the fact that the applicant was in custody than anything else. He was assessed as posing a low risk of re-offending generally, though somewhat confusingly the pre-sentence report later stated both that the applicant did not pose an imminent risk of significant harm and that he did pose a high risk of harm to the public.
7. The judge also had before him a victim impact statement from the deceased's mother which we have read. It spoke movingly about the loss which she and the entire family had suffered and about the grief which inevitably accompanied that loss.
8. In passing sentence the learned judge accepted that the deceased had head-butted the applicant. There was medical evidence to support that contention. There was also scientific evidence to support the contention that the deceased had taken hold of the applicant's clothing. We accept that in both of those regards what the applicant had said in his prepared statement was borne out. The judge commented, as was certainly the case, that the jury was sure that at the time of the stabbing the applicant intended at the least to cause the deceased really serious injury, but recognised that as a result of the provocation the verdict had been one of guilty of manslaughter. The jury rejected self-defence. The judge adverted to the fact that there had been several stabs and to the fact that the deceased had been unarmed. The judge also had in mind that the deceased was a much bigger man than the applicant, though both were of a similar age.
9. In considering the principles that should govern his sentence, the judge said that there could be nothing other than a lengthy term of detention in a young offender institution. He referred to the fact that ten years ago the Court of Appeal had said that, where an offender deliberately goes out with a knife, carries it as a weapon and uses it to cause death, even if there is provocation, he should expect to receive on conviction in a contested case a sentence in the region of ten to twelve years. That was a reference to one of the authorities drawn to our attention, that of
Attorney General's Reference No 33 of 1996
(
R v Latham
) [1997] 2 Cr App R(S) 10. The judge went on to state that even the most recent guidelines did not materially depart from that principle. That was a reference to the recently published guideline by the Sentencing Guidelines Council in relation to manslaughter by reason of provocation. However, said the judge, life had changed a good deal in the last ten years. He referred to the widespread public concern relating to the carrying of knives by young people. Having considered all the points in mitigation and the points referred to in the pre-sentence report, the judge concluded that, although an indeterminate sentence was inappropriate having regard to the applicant's good character, a lengthy term of detention was inevitable and that the right term was one of nine years.
10. In support of this application several proposed grounds are put before us. We have considered them. We regard them as properly arguable and we grant leave to appeal. We have taken into account all of the matters raised in the written material placed before us both by way of written advice and grounds of appeal and by way of a recently submitted skeleton argument.
11. The central points made are that the sentence passed insufficiently allowed for the appellant's age and good character. Secondly, it is submitted that in a case in which the verdict was based on provocation, deterrence should have played less of a part in the sentencing process than it appears to have done. Thirdly, it is submitted that the sentence insufficiently recognised the principles set out by this court in
R v Suratan and Others
[2002] EWCA Crim 2982
, both as to the reduced importance of deterrence when sentencing in a provocation case, and as to the importance of recognising the elements of a successful defence of provocation. It is further submitted that, having regard to a variety of authorities which have been placed before us, the judge adopted a wrong starting point. We have taken account of all of the authorities cited, though all to some degree turn on their own facts and most arose before the publication by the Sentencing Guidelines Council of the guideline to which we have referred.
12. We turn to consider that guideline. Where there is a low degree of provocation, the Sentencing Guidelines Council suggests in relation to an adult a sentencing range of between ten years and life in custody, with a starting point of twelve years. Where there has been a substantial degree of provocation, the suggested sentencing range is one of four to nine years, with a starting point of eight years again in the case of an adult. Where there is a high degree of provocation, the starting point is one of three years. The sentencing range (if custody is necessary) is one of up to four years.
13. We have considered into which of these brackets this case properly falls. We conclude that it falls into the bracket involving a substantial degree of provocation. It seems to us that that is the only reasonable conclusion, having regard to the fact that there was no independent evidence as to how the incident started, and that there was scientific evidence to support the proposition that the deceased (on any fair view the larger man) had head-butted and grabbed hold of the appellant. Accordingly, we look at a sentencing range of four to nine years, with a starting point of eight years' custody in respect of an adult offender.
14. However, there are two qualifications that we think it right to place upon the application of the guideline in this case. The first is that the Sentencing Guidelines Council purports to be doing no more than to be issuing guidelines; it is not setting fixed or rigid boundaries. Secondly, although we have taken into account the youth of the appellant and all the points made by Mr Salon QC on his behalf, we also have in mind that it is young men of this sort of age who are very frequently carrying the knives about which there is such heightened, and in our view justifiable, public concern.
15. We do accept, having regard to the guideline, the youth and good character of the appellant and all of the points made on his behalf, that the sentence of nine years' detention in a young offender institution was too high. But in our judgment it would be wrong, particularly in the light of the public concern to which we have just referred, to substitute a sentence lower than one of eight years' detention in a young offender institution. To that limited extent this appeal is allowed.
16.
MR SALON:
My Lord, thank you very much. There is an application for a representation order.
17.
LORD JUSTICE DYSON:
Yes, you may have that -- limited to one counsel. It is very nice to see you Mr Salon, but it must be for one junior counsel. Thank you.","citation:

MR V SCULLY
appeared on behalf of the Appellant
_________
J U D G M E N T
LORD JUSTICE WARBY:
1.
This is an appeal against sentence by Vienna Israel, aged 40. On 23 March 2022 in the Crown Court at Isleworth she was sentenced to two years and eight months' imprisonment for one count of robbery to which she had earlier pleaded guilty.
2.
The offence was a street robbery or mugging of a man aged 71 called Michael Farrer. It took place at about 9 am on Wednesday 27 October 2021 at an ATM outside a post office on Golborne Road, London. The complainant approached the ATM, looking round as he usually did to make sure that he was not being watched.  He did not see this, but the appellant was behind him waiting to act. As he withdrew £150 from the ATM she approached him from behind and grabbed at the money. There was a scuffle lasting several seconds during which the complainant was struck in the stomach by the appellant's left elbow. He in due course released his grip on his cash and the appellant made off with it.
3.
In a statement made on the day of the robbery the victim described being shaken up, having already been deaf in one ear, unsteady on his feet and on heightened alert. He spoke of anxiety such that on his way home he had been concerned that he was being followed. The incident had left him fearful of using that ATM and he had changed his habits as a result.
4.
The incident had been captured on CCTV and the appellant was identifiable because in the scuffle she had dropped her mobile phone, with part of her name showing on the lock screen, and a scarf which returned a DNA match. She was arrested and interviewed on 10 January 2022 when she declined to answer police questions but gave a prepared statement saying that she could not recall the offence because of her daily drug use.
5.
She had three previous convictions for possession of class B drugs and 21 other convictions for a further 48 offences between 1998, when she was aged 16, and the date of this offence. The previous offences included 28 theft, fraud and other acquisitive offences and three offences against the person. There was no previous offence of robbery.
6.
The appellant's account as given to probation was that at the time of the offence she had been largely street homeless and ""very bad on drugs"" using about £250-worth a day, funded by thefts and sex work. She was a mother of six, all of her children having been taken into care. There was some evidence of mental health difficulties.
7.
The Probation Officer's assessment was that this was a ""relatively unsophisticated robbery"" but one carried out with a degree of forethought. The victim's vulnerability was considered likely to have been a factor in the appellant's decision to attempt the offence. The offending was identified as an escalation given that the appellant's history disclosed mainly non-violent offending, save for an offence of grievous bodily harm at the age of 16 over 20 years earlier. Her drug use was considered the critical factor and one which would continue to spur acquisitive offending.
8.
The author of the pre-sentence report assumed that the court would impose a custodial sentence. If the court wished to consider suspending that sentence the author did not feel able to put forward a realistic package of requirements. She noted that as things stood the appellant would be released street homeless with a high risk of relapse and re-offending. Her response to previous supervision had been poor with repeated failures to engage with probation leading to a number of breaches. She was in breach of a community order at the time of this offending. The author suggested that time in a structured environment to engage in treatment away from the stresses and temptations of the community might be helpful to the appellant in the long term. She would have time to work with appropriate support agencies to plan for her release from custody.
9.
The sentencing judge, His Honour Judge Hammerton, was also provided with a drug rehabilitation requirement report from Turning Point. This concluded that the appellant was ""using drugs problematically"" but suggested that she appeared motivated to access treatment and was ""appropriate"" for a treatment pathway of fortnightly one-to-ones and 12 weekly plan reviews with a focus on alcohol dependency if appropriate.
10.
The judge assessed the appellant's culpability as falling within Category B of the guideline.  He said the force used was somewhere between very significant and minimal, the elbow in the stomach being a key factor. The harm, said the judge, was at the lower end of Category 2 given the change in lifestyle forced upon the victim. The starting point was thus one of four years with a range of between three and six. The judge identified three aggravating features: the appellant's previous convictions, her targeting of someone known to be vulnerable and the commission of the offence whilst subject to a community order. There were three mitigating factors: the conditions in custody at the time, the appellant's mental health issues and the absence of any previous robbery conviction. Taking account also of the appellant's personal mitigation, the sentence after a trial would have been one of 48 months. After full credit for her guilty plea the sentence was one of 32 months. The community order was revoked.
11.
The judge's conclusions meant that he could not suspend the sentence. But he said that he had ""anxiously considered"" the guidelines for the imposition of custodial and community sentences and he had concluded that it would not have been appropriate to impose a community order having regard to the appellant's poor record of compliance.
12.
The single judge gave the appellant leave to advance three grounds of appeal, which Mr Scully has ably argued before us today on her behalf. It is said that the sentencing judge, first, mis-categorised the culpability and secondly mis-categorised the harm with the result that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Thirdly, it is said that the sentence after reduction of plea should not have been more than two years' imprisonment and should in all the circumstances have been suspended.
13.
We have reflected on these submissions, attractively presented as they were. As for culpability, the prosecution and the Probation Officer both suggested that the case fell into Category C as it involved the ""threat or use of minimal force"". We can see why.  But like the judge we have viewed the CCTV recording and we think he was right to reject that view of the matter.  We accept of course that the offence of robbery will always require some force to be used, but here the force was more prolonged than it is in the typical case of low-level street robbery which involves mere snatching with brief or no physical contact. Here there was a tussle and also the elbow in the ribs, which takes the case up to the scale. In our judgment the degree of force deployed to wrestle the cash from the victim was properly assessed as more than ""minimal"". It falls into Category B which covers the threat of violence by a weapon produced or not and ""other cases that fall between Categories A and C.""
14.
That said, the force used here does fall very much at the lower end of Category B, given the modest degree of force involved and the fact that Category A involves the use of a weapon to inflict violence, or ""very significant"" force, or the production of a blade or real or imitation firearm to threaten violence.
15.
We take a similar view of the case when it comes to harm. The Probation Officer suggested this might be in harm Category 1. The prosecution persuaded the judge that it was in Category 2. The appellant submits that it was a case in Category 3, involving ""no/minimal physical or psychological harm"".  In support of that submission Mr Scully has referred us to the case of
R v Calvo and Smith
[2017] EWCA Crim 1354
where this court granted a Reference by the Attorney General. The point made is that the evidence in that case was that the victim was ""very shaken"" but the harm was treated as minimal.
16.
Like the sentencing judge we derive no real assistance from that case. On the evidence before him in this case the judge was entitled to reject the notion that this 71-year-old victim suffered no harm at all or only minimal harm. The judge was entitled to conclude that there was some psychological impact which placed the case in harm Category 2 but at the lower end.
17.
It follows that in our judgment the judge identified the correct sentencing bracket. He also correctly identified the aggravating and mitigating factors. Having done so, however, he arrived at a notional sentence after a trial which matched the category starting point.  In our judgment, he fell into error at this stage. The location of the culpability and harm factors at the bottom end of each scale required an initial downward adjustment of the category starting point to the bottom of the category range. Although the aggravating features were significant, we do not think they outbalanced the mitigation. The appellant's previous offending was of lesser severity and, viewed in context, relatively old. Accordingly, the four-year notional sentence after a trial was manifestly excessive.  We do not consider that in all the circumstances a sentence of more than three years would have been merited after the trial. Applying the full one-third credit for the early guilty plea, which was first indicated in the Magistrates' Court, we arrive at a sentence of two years' imprisonment.
18.
We cannot however uphold the third ground of appeal, which Mr Scully did not press in his oral submissions. The judge expressly considered the imposition guidelines and the issue of whether a non-custodial option was realistic. He concluded that it was not for reasons that, if sound, inevitably hold good for the alternative option of a suspended sentence with requirements. The appellant's personal history and circumstances do attract sympathy but do not amount to strong personal mitigation. The key issue was whether there was a realistic prospect of rehabilitation. The clear view of probation was that a non-custodial sentence was impracticable and that the only realistic prospect of rehabilitation lay in treatment within the context of a custodial sentence, which we are told is now something available to the appellant. The difference between the pre-sentence report and the DRR report was stark, the pivotal issue being how realistic it was that the appellant would adhere to the DRR plan. The Probation Officer was so sceptical that she felt unable to identify any alternative to immediate custody. Those views were based on a careful review of the appellant's track record. The DRR report made no in-depth assessment of the question. Indeed it contained no acknowledgment of the appellant's lamentable history of non-compliance which, as the judge noted, included failing to turn up for an appointment at Turning Point itself. It is unclear whether the author of the DRR report was even aware of those matters. The judge's view was plainly open to him and cannot be categorised as wrong in principle.
19.
For those reasons, we quash the sentence of two years and eight months' immediate imprisonment and substitute a sentence of two years' immediate imprisonment. To that extent this appeal succeeds.","citation:

1.
LORD JUSTICE MOSES: This is an appeal against sentence of seven years' imprisonment in respect of what are notoriously difficult and distressing cases. Nothing the sentencing judge, nor this court on appeal, can say will ever measure the impact of the death of a young child on family relations and friends. We have read the statement from the mother of young Michaela who died and, whilst we can never feel the same tragic emotion that she must feel, we can readily appreciate it. But the death of this young child was caused in a remarkably short period by this appellant, whose behaviour prior to the incident in May 2004 could never have been expected.
2.
The appellant had started to live with Michaela's mother, Amanda Richards, in Plymouth in February. Although there had been thought to be some dispute about this, by the time the judge came to sentence it was plain that this appellant had exhibited no feelings or animosity or violence towards the young child he killed. Michaela was one of four young children. The appellant was apparently good towards them and had devoted all of his limited resources towards their upkeep - this was not something Michaela's mother had experienced before.
3.
The occasion of Michaela's death was her birthday. She was only two. The appellant had bought her presents and had taken her on 12th May to Plymouth town centre whilst the rest of the children were at school. He returned at a time that, whilst there was some dispute about it at trial, appears to have been 2.49 in the afternoon. It would take about two to three minutes for him, with Michaela, to walk from the bus stop to home, possibly slightly more. It is clear from computer records that an ambulance was called at 2.52. Thus, the occasion of the killing of Michaela took place in a very short period indeed, probably about two minutes. It appears that this appellant lost his temper and shook her in a way that caused her immediate death. Just after that the appellant came out of the house carrying Michaela in his arms. She was limp, unconscious and having difficulty breathing. When the local residents came to help the ambulance was called at the time we have identified.
4.
Unfortunately, but not unusually in cases of this kind, the appellant was unable to face what he had in fact done and both before and during the trial denied that he was responsible for the injuries which, as the doctor said, must have been the result of shaking with considerable force and were inconsistent with any fall from the bed as had been suggested.
5.
As we have said, the appellant denied that he was responsible and he was charged with murder. At the close of the prosecution case the judge, Owen J, ruled that there was insufficient evidence of a murderous intention. Manslaughter was left to the jury.
6.
We can well understand that, having faced a charge of murder and having had that dismissed only immediately before he was due to give evidence, the appellant felt unable to accept his responsibility at that stage. Thus the issue of manslaughter went before the jury and he was convicted of that offence.
7.
The judge, in his sentencing remarks, accepted that the appellant was very good with the children and their siblings. He pointed out that there was no suggestion of any violence towards the children in the past, nor of animosity.
8.
The judge was faced with a young man of 23, and, as we have said, sentenced him in July 2005 to seven years' imprisonment. The issue is whether that sentence was manifestly excessive.
9.
There were important mitigating features in relation to this case. We have already identified the absence of any animosity or history of previous cruelty, let alone injury, towards the children. There was positive evidence of the appellant's good behaviour in supporting Michaela and the other children. The offence was not premeditated and took place, as we have said, in a very short space of time. This appellant had not been in trouble for offences such as this before. Not only was he only 23 at the time of his trial, he unfortunately suffered from limited intelligence amounting to a borderline learning disability. He had sought immediate help for the child as soon as he had shaken her in a way to cause her death. Against that, it has to be said that this was a very young girl of two who required the protection of the courts. The impact on the family, as we have said, was devastating and will continue to be.
10.
In those circumstances, we have had to consider whether the sentence of seven years was manifestly excessive.
11.
Our attention was drawn to a number of authorities. The authority of greatest assistance is the case of
Yates
[2001] Cr App R (S) 428. In that case this court identified the range of sentences on a plea of guilty as between two and five years and reduced a sentence of seven years in that case to one of five years. As Mr Evans QC, on behalf of this appellant, has pointed out, that case appears to be slightly worse in some respects since there was no evidence of any remorse, in contrast to this case, and there was evidence of previous incidents of violence towards the victim, but the appellant pleaded guilty. The fact that this appellant did not plead guilty, particularly in the face of a charge of murder, does not indicate that he did not suffer remorse. Moreover, we fully understand how it was difficult for him at so very late a stage once the murder charge had been dismissed, to change the unfortunate approach that he had adopted of denying his responsibility.
12.
We take the view that having regard to the mitigating factors which we have identified, notwithstanding the gravity of this offence, a sentence of seven years was manifestly excessive. Our view is that a sentence of five years' imprisonment would have been appropriate, reducing that sentence therefore by two years. In those circumstances we shall allow the appeal and substitute the sentence of seven years for one of five years' imprisonment.","citation:

Judgment
The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales:
1.
This is an appeal by W against his conviction on 24 July 2009 in the Crown Court at Southwark before His Honour Judge Hardy of misconduct in a public office. It raises an interesting question about the state of mind required before this common law offence whose origins can be traced back to the thirteenth century can be established. (See Pollock and Maitland, The History of English Law 2
nd
edition (1898) Vol 2 p 520/521)).
2.
Between 1999 and 2008 the appellant was a serving police officer in the Metropolitan Police. It was alleged that in that capacity between 1 July 2006 and 5 October 2007 he wilfully misconducted himself by improperly using an American Express (AMEX) credit card to the extent that he incurred expenditure of approximately £12,500 for personal use funded from public monies. Save to the extent that it arose from his employment as a police officer the misconduct did not take the form of a breach of or failure to perform his duties as a police officer.
3.
The evidence to support the misuse of the AMEX card was clear. At the material time the appellant was heavily in debt. He admitted that, contrary to Force Instructions, he used the AMEX card for personal expenditure as well as official expenses but said that he did so believing that he was entitled to use it in this way provided he intended to refund the cost attributable to personal expenditure. This practice was widely followed by very large numbers of his colleagues. Therefore although he had wilfully used the card in the way alleged, he denied that he was guilty of deliberate misconduct or dishonesty. For completeness, we should record that the Crown did not accept the exculpatory elements of the appellant’s case.
4.
At the earlier stages of the trial process, it was expressly alleged that the appellant had acted dishonestly but that allegation was not made either when the case was opened, nor indeed in the Crown’s closing submissions to the jury. However when the appellant gave evidence, although the allegation of dishonesty was not put directly to him, he was cross examined on the basis that he had acted dishonestly. Comparisons were made between the conduct of the appellant and shoplifting, reference was made to the fact that he had in effect given himself a “whopping pay rise”, promoted himself to a higher rank with “quite a hike in pay”, and treated the card as “some sort of cash cow”, or as a “bank, really”. The theme of his answers to these questions was that he honestly thought that he could use the card for his personal use provided he intended to repay the sums in due course and that he did so intend. He was reflecting the “culture in the office at the time” and he “knew that officers more senior to him were doing it to”. He honestly believed that he was doing nothing wrong “…so long as I paid it back I did not see that it was wrong”.
5.
Before the summing up it was submitted to the judge that the ingredients of the offence of misconduct in a public office required specific focus on the defendant’s subjective state of mind. The only authority to which he was referred was
Attorney General’s Reference (No 3 of 2003
)
[2005] QB 73
. One of the questions for the opinion of the court was: “What are the ingredients of the common law offence of misconduct in a public office?”. Following the death of an apparently healthy man detained in a police station, a number of police officers were charged with gross negligence manslaughter and, alternatively, misconduct in a public office because they failed in their duty properly to care for the man. It was held that:
“There must be an awareness of the duty to act or a subjective recklessness as to the existence of the duties. The recklessness test will apply to the question whether in particular circumstances a duty arises at all as well as to the conduct of the defendant if it does. The subjective test applies both to reckless indifference to the legality of the act or omission and in relation to the consequences of the act or omission”.
In short, even in the context of misconduct said to arise from failure to perform a police duty, it was necessary for the Crown to establish some subjective mental element.
6.
The Crown submitted that no such ingredient was required. It was therefore not open to the appellant to advance a defence on the basis that he was not dishonest. That argument may well be unanswerable in the context of police disciplinary proceedings, but its application to the trial in a criminal court of misconduct which involves a police officer misappropriating public funds for his own use seems surprising.
7.
The judge concluded that the
Attorney General Reference (No 3 of 2003)
was not a case “on all fours” with the present case, and that it “may be in that case there were elements of recklessness that the jury had to be directed about”. They did not apply to the present case. He was determined to give directions to the jury which would make the law “as uncomplicated as possible”. In short, the judge rejected the appellant’s contention in relation to the defendant’s subjective state of mind at the time of his actions: accordingly no such direction was given. Its absence provides the basis for the present appeal. The jury was directed that the prosecution had to prove that the appellant “wilfully – that means to say, deliberately – misconducted himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust in that office holder, without reasonable excuse or justification. …the prosecution must prove misconduct of a high degree. We are not talking here about a mere bending of the rules or cutting corners…to amount to abuse of public trust a mistake, even a serious one, will not suffice either. The prosecution must prove that the office holder has fallen way below, or far below, the standards expected of him as, in this case, a police officer”. He effectively repeated this direction shortly before the jury retired.
8.
The offence of misconduct in a public office may arise from acts or omissions by holders of that office, and depending on the acts and omissions alleged, the mental element of the offence will vary. The Law Commission Consultation Paper on Corruption, Legislating the Criminal Code, 1997, in a passage addressing the offence of misconduct in a public office records, perhaps unsurprisingly in view of the antiquity of the offence, that it is not “easily defined”. It refers to the Salmon Report which observed that the offence “embraces a wide variety of misconduct including acts done with a dishonest, oppressive or corrupt motive”. It also highlights a paper by PD Finn, entitled “Official Misconduct” [1978] 2 Crim LJ 308, in which the difficulty of attempting a definition of the offence is acknowledged but its principal applications are said to include: (a) frauds and deceits (fraud in office); (b) wilful neglect of duty (nonfeasance); (c) “malicious” exercises of official authority (misfeasance); (d) wilful excesses of official authority (malfeasance); and (e) the intentional infliction of bodily harm, imprisonment, or other injury upon a person (oppression). Accordingly the nature of the conduct falling within the ambit of the offence is very wide, and logically it would follow that any necessary element relating to the defendant’s subjective state of mind cannot be identical for each and every one of its different manifestations.
9.
The Committee on Standards in Public Life also issued a consultation paper on the offence of Misuse of Public Office in 1997. It recommended the creation of a new offence.
“18. The unifying factor of the common law cases appears to be the existence of some improper, dishonest or oppressive motive in the exercise or refusal to exercise some public function, rather than a mere abuse of power. There are few prosecutions, suggesting that action is taken only when the conduct is particularly gross. The advantage of creating a statutory offence of misuse of public office would be that some clearer indication could be given in the statute of the circumstances in which an offence might occur. The limits should not have to be drawn by the jury unguided.
19. We consider that the new offence might …identify the two situations in which an offence might occur as unlawfully incurring expenditure, or incurring expenditure as a result of wilful misconduct”.
10.
Both consultation papers reflect a careful analysis of the existing authorities. The breadth of the offence is underlined by two contrasting, relatively recent decisions of this court. In
R v Llewellyn-Jones
[1968] 1 QB 429 a County Court Registrar exercised his judicial responsibility in such a way that he gained an “improper” financial advantage for himself. His appeal was directed at the absence of any express allegation of dishonesty, but was dismissed on the basis that dishonesty or fraud were inherent in the offence. In this case, the court was focussing on the nature of the misconduct alleged, which took the form of deceit and fraud. On the other hand in
R v Dytham
[1979] 2 QB 722
a police officer deliberately neglected to intervene to prevent what turned out to be a homicidal attack. He failed to respond to what he knew to be his duty. He was plainly not dishonest. In the context of the misconduct alleged, the court observed that the offence was “not restricted to dishonesty”, an observation which carries the clear implication that dishonesty would be a necessary ingredient of some manifestations of the offence.
11.
Like
Attorney General (No 3 of 2003
) these decisions are entirely consistent with many earlier authorities which underlined that what we shall describe as a criminal state of mind is required. Thus, nearly 200 years ago, in
R v Borron
[1820] 3B and Ald 432, in the context of misconduct by a magistrate, Abbott CJ said:
“…the question has
always
been, not whether the act done might, upon full and mature investigation, be found strictly right, but from what motive it had proceeded; whether from a dishonest, oppressive, or corrupt motive, under which description fear and favour may generally be included, or from mistake or error. In the former case, alone, they have become the objects of punishment. ” (Our emphasis)
12.
In argument before us Mr Miller for the Crown submitted that the ingredients of the offence were (a) an intentional act by the defendant and (b) that the defendant “must know what he was doing was wrong” and (c) that the act must be “serious” or “have serious consequences”. In the course of the argument (b) was amplified to “it must be wrong and he must know it was wrong”. When invited to explain what “wrong” meant in this context, he suggested “misuse or abuse of the card”. If however the appellant deliberately misused the card (whose only purpose was to cover expenses) in circumstances which he knew were wrong, it is very hard to see how his state of mind does not require to be addressed as dishonesty.
13.
We have been unable to discover any authority which suggests that the observations in
R v Borron
are no longer apposite to a case like the present, and indeed,
R v Llewellyn Jones
confirms their continuing applicability.
Attorney General Reference (No3 of 2003)
reinforces the requirement for some subjective mental element, appropriate to whatever form of misconduct is alleged. It would be wrong in principle to extend the ambit of an ancient common law offence by narrowing the requirements relating to the defendant’s state of mind (
R v Rimmington
[2006] 1 AC 459
. Consistently with principle, and addressing the realities, it is in any event difficult to see how the defendant can have fallen so far below the standards required of him as a police officer that, in the context of the misuse of a card issued to him by his superiors for “expenses”, his conduct is properly to be stigmatised as criminal, unless he was dishonest.
14.
In our judgment it is clearly established that when the crime of misconduct in a public office is committed in circumstances which involve the acquisition of property by theft or fraud, and in particular when the holder of a public office is alleged to have made improper claims for public funds in circumstances which are said to be criminal, an essential ingredient of the offence is proof that the defendant was dishonest.
15.
The directions to the jury omitted this ingredient. Accordingly it is conceivable that the jury may have concluded that the act was “wrong” because the defendant flagrantly broke the rules governing the use of the card without being sure that he was dishonest: alternatively, they may have convicted him because in their view he plainly was dishonest, but without receiving any direction from the judge about how to approach the dishonesty issue. Although the evidence appears to have been powerful, the question whether the appellant was acting dishonestly, or not, is pre-eminently one for the jury after a correct direction from the judge. The conviction will be quashed. Although the penalty in court was relatively modest, the ramifications of the case are important. We shall order a new trial.","citation:

1.
MR JUSTICE TREACY: On 1st May 2012 in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton, Rashpal Kaur was convicted of a number of offences. On 5th October 2012 she was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment. She was convicted on all 22 counts of the indictment. Eighteen counts were for offences contrary to section 111A(1)(a) of the Social Security (Administration) Act. Three counts related to converting criminal property under section 327(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and there was one count of perverting the course of justice. The applicant was convicted of 17 counts relating to obtaining housing benefit and council tax benefit between 2003 and 2007. The applicant had represented and failed to declare that she was not a single parent and that she was related to her landlord. She had also failed to notify the local authority of her bank and building society accounts and the monies passing through them. Something like £270,000 had passed through her accounts. Two counts related to the completion of benefit claim forms for a friend. Two counts related to a claim for carer's allowance in 2009 when she failed to declare that she was employed, and the count of perverting the course of justice related to the production of a false document to the local authority in order to try to undermine a witness against her. In general terms the defence to the charges was a denial of any dishonest behaviour or the deliberate submission of any false information.
2.
The trial began on 16th April 2012. The prosecution witnesses were fully cross-examined on behalf of the applicant. The applicant gave evidence in chief on 24th April, apparently without difficulty, setting out her defence count by count and giving details in relation to specific counts. On the following day she failed to attend court. A doctor's note was submitted. It stated that she was unable to attend due to anxiety and depression. The proceedings were adjourned.
3.
The court reconvened on the following day, 26th April. The applicant attended court and was cross-examined for most of the day. The prosecutor had not completed cross-examination and anticipated continuing to test the applicant's account with detailed questions based on the substantial paperwork available in this case. However, this never happened because on the following day, 27th April, the applicant did not attend court and a further doctor's note was submitted. It stated that the applicant was suicidal and unable to attend court. The judge adjourned proceedings for the day and over the weekend. The court resumed on 30th April 2012. The applicant did not attend court. The judge ruled that the trial must proceed. In so ruling the judge accepted, on the basis of the material provided to him, that the applicant was unfit and would continue to be unfit for the foreseeable future. The prosecution urged the judge to continue with the case. The defence said that the applicant would be prejudiced. The judge ruled that the case should proceed. He said that the applicant would not be prejudiced. She had given all her evidence in chief. She had been cross-examined on most of the counts on the indictment. The judge recognised that the defence might wish to raise some matters in re-examination, but said he had to take a pragmatic approach and be fair to both sides. The trial had reached a stage at which he considered it ought to continue. The party who was going to be prejudiced was the Crown who would not be able to continue its cross-examination. Accordingly, the trial proceeded.
4.
The judge explained the applicant's absence to the jury in terms which made it plain that her absence was for good reason and that they should not hold it against her. There is no complaint about the way he dealt with that.
5.
Subsequent to the trial a psychiatric report has been obtained from a registrar in forensic psychiatry. The applicant seeks to rely on it as fresh evidence. The report is from Dr Anis Ahmed and dated 10th August 2012. It confirms that the applicant was suffering from a moderate, recurrent, depressive disorder. In our view, it does not materially add to the information available to the judge who accepted that the applicant was suffering from a mental condition which meant that she was unable to continue to attend the trial. We have read the report de bene esse. It is capable of belief and would have been admissible at the trial. We consider that in the circumstances it could not reasonably have been obtained at the time of the trial. However, it does not seem to us that Dr Ahmed's evidence would afford any ground for allowing the appeal because it does not materially add to the information available to the judge. It merely confirms it. Accordingly, there is no need for us to receive the statement as fresh evidence.
6.
As part of Mr Brunt's submissions to us this morning he has drawn attention to paragraph 38 of Dr Ahmed's report in which this applicant reported to Dr Ahmed that she found it difficult to cope with the number of allegations against her and that her she was unable to remember evidence as she felt that her memory was failing. That of course is a self-report which is passed on to the court through the report of Dr Ahmed. We have considered that, bearing in mind that it is a self-report from this applicant and bearing in mind that the judge was in a position to consider the applicant's evidence as given in chief and in cross-examination, and in the knowledge that a medical report had been submitted indicating the difficulties under which she was said to be labouring. In the circumstances we are not persuaded that the matter highlighted by Mr Brunt is something which affects the position or which would lead us to admit Dr Ahmed's report into evidence.
7.
The grounds of appeal assert that the applicant was genuinely ill and thus that the judge wrongly exercised his discretion to continue the trial since her absence was involuntary. The correct course, Mr Brunt urges, would have been a discharge of the jury with a retrial at a later date. Thus the applicant could have given her evidence in full and in particular would have had the opportunity to give clarifying evidence by way of re-examination. The Crown submits that the judge's ruling was correct. The applicant had been able to set out her case in full. It was the Crown who was prejudiced by her absence as it could not put the counter-case to her evidence based on the available documents. It was not unfair to the applicant to continue with the trial.
8.
The leading authority in this area is
R v Anthony Jones
[2002] 2 Cr.App.R 9
. In that case the House of Lords held that a judge had a discretion to start or continue a trial in a defendant's absence. Such discretion was to be exercised with great caution and with close regard to the overall fairness of the proceedings. A defendant inflicted by involuntary illness or incapacity would have much stronger grounds for resisting the continuation of the trial than a person who had voluntarily chosen to abscond. In the case of involuntary illness, it would rarely if ever be right to exercise a discretion in favour of continuing the trial, at any rate until the defendant was represented and asked that the trial should begin. In exercising the court's discretion, fairness to the defendant was of prime importance but fairness to the prosecution should also be taken into account. The judge should have regard to all the circumstances.
9.
A checklist of relevant matters was approved. Applying those to this case: the applicant's absence was involuntary; a short adjournment would not have assisted; a retrial would have been needed; the applicant continued to be represented by competent counsel with full instructions; there was no danger of the jury misinterpreting the reason for the applicant's absence or holding it against her. The events in the trial went back over many years but delay would not of itself be significant because much of the evidence was documentary. The trial was a substantial one and had no doubt been expensive to run. It had nearly reached its conclusion.
10.
All of those factors are uncontroversial. The only matter of controversy relates to unfairness. The applicant says she was prejudiced because she was not available for re-examination. The Crown says it was prejudiced because it was not able to test significant parts of the applicant's account in cross-examination.
11.
The question for us is whether the judge's decision was wrong and whether it had the result of making the applicant's trial unfair and subsequent conviction unsafe. Whilst the judge has a discretion, this court is able to examine the exercise of that discretion and will intervene if it appears that the judge's conclusion was clearly wrong or not reasonably open to him or may have resulted in injustice to the applicant. The situation confronting the judge was different to that which would have faced him had the applicant been ill at the start of the trial. By the time the applicant was absent from the trial it had advanced very substantially. The applicant had been able fully to test the prosecution evidence and to put forward her own explanations in evidence in chief. The judge was in a good position to assess the competing arguments as to prejudice. He clearly felt that the balance came down in favour of the Crown in terms of prejudice suffered. The judge was conscious of the involuntary nature of the applicant's absence and notwithstanding that concluded that the trial should continue.
12.
We do not consider that his ruling is one which can be impugned as wrong in the way contended for. He had a difficult ruling to make, but it was one which was properly open to him in all the circumstances. We therefore grant leave to appeal in relation to conviction as the matter was plainly arguable, but we dismiss the appeal.
13.
We turn then to sentence. It is argued that 32 months was simply too long for a woman of 44 without previous convictions and who has not committed a crime requiring public protection. The offending took place over a six year period. It covered three types of benefit or allowance and three different addresses. The applicant obtained around £27,000 of public money to which she was not entitled. During that time, some £270,000 passed through her bank or building society accounts, so there was no question of hardship being involved. The judge accurately described it as a professional fraud. In addition, there was a fraud for the benefit of a friend of hers and, having seen the Crown's evidence against her, she attempted to pervert the course of justice. The judge correctly identified the category of offence under the relevant Sentencing Guidelines Council's guideline for fraud carried out on multiple occasions in a professional manner over a significant period of time. The starting point of two years in that category is based on £60,000 obtained. This appellant obtained a lesser sum. The judge accordingly reduced the starting point to a term of 20 months within the range which starts at 18 months in order to cover the false claims for benefit. He added four months consecutively for the offences relating to the applicant's friend, and eight months consecutively to those sentences for the separate offence of perverting the course of justice. We do not consider that the sentences can properly be criticised in the circumstances. The available medical evidence confirms that the applicant's mental state would not have inhibited her ability to provide correct and truthful information to the authorities at the material time.
14.
There is, in our judgment, no arguable basis for interfering with this sentence. Accordingly, we refuse leave and the sentence application is dismissed.","citation:

1.
LORD JUSTICE HUGHES: The issue raised in this appeal against conviction is whether the trial judge went wrong in allowing the Crown to put in under the hearsay provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
an edited witness statement by a witness who had failed to attend. The charges were familiar enough. They alleged possession by the defendant of 79 ecstasy tablets and a small quantity of ketamine contained in three separate plastic envelopes at a nightclub. The charges were of possession with intent to supply of those two different classes of drug. Those charges of course included the implied alternative of simple possession.
2.
The Crown's case as served was as follows. First, scientific evidence of analysis, which was not in dispute. Second, evidence of the finding of an inconsequential sum of money on the defendant. Thirdly, the evidence of a security guard at the club, which was in King's Cross. Fourthly, evidence of the police officers who were called out. There was also available evidence of interviews with the defendant conducted by the police but in those he elected to answer no questions and so those took the matter no further.
3.
The security guard was a man called Chambers. His thirteen line witness statement said that as a result of something said to him by a customer (and he said what it was), he took the defendant to his office and told him that he suspected that he had drugs on him. He said that he asked the defendant either to produce them or to wait for the police. He said that the defendant initially denied having anything of the kind, but that when he (Chambers) got out his telephone to ring the police, the defendant produced the bag of pills and the other drugs and put them on the table. According to him, the defendant said that a man in a black baseball cap had asked him to look after the drugs. Chambers' witness statement said that the drugs were removed from the crotch area of the defendant's trousers or underwear.
4.
As to the police officers, the evidence from them was that they arrived at the club having been sent for, saw the defendant in the company of the club staff, including Mr Chambers the security guard, and took possession of the drugs. One of the police officers asked the defendant, according to his witness statement: ""Are these yours?"" and he received the answer, according to him: ""Yes, but I am only looking after them for a friend."" That question had been asked by the police officers, wrongly, without any caution being administered to the defendant. To anticipate, the Recorder ruled that exchange inadmissible, so that evidence of an admission of possession by the defendant was not available to be put before the jury.
5.
On 10th July 2006 a plea and case management hearing was conducted. At that hearing the trial was given the fixed date of Monday 15th January, six months on. The witness Mr Chambers and also the police officers were required, quite properly, by those representing the defendant to attend at the trial.
6.
On the day of the trial, Mr Chambers was not at court and nobody knew where he was. The Crown applied to read his witness statement under the provisions of
section 116(2)(d)
of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
. That provides so far as material:
""In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if—
...
(d) ... the relevant person cannot be found although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken...""
The Recorder admitted the statement, albeit in a form edited to remove from it the assertion that the drugs had been in a hidden place in the defendant's trousers and the exchange about the man in the black baseball cap.
7.
The present appeal is brought on the basis that that ruling of the Recorder was wrong and that the conviction is as a result unsafe. Mr Lynn says that without the evidence of Mr Chambers the Crown was in no position to prove that the defendant was in possession of the drugs at all, before one got on to the question of intent to supply. He says that there would thus have been no case to answer.
8.
The argument about this application by the Crown, of which we have a full transcript, proceeded rather more by discussion than by consecutive submissions and ruling. It is none the worse for that; that is often how cases proceed. It is perhaps the reason why in the end it was not approached sequentially, although the decisions that the Recorder made are perfectly clear. In the different circumstances of this court we are able to, and think we should, deal with the questions which arise step by step.
9.
First, in order to dispose of the point, this was of course a late application and that point was made on behalf of the defendant. The answer to that is that it was late because it was unavoidably late. The application was only triggered by the non-appearance of the witness. The Recorder was right to entertain it on its merits and decide it one way or the other.
10.
Next is the question whether the witness Mr Chambers was somebody who ""cannot be found"" within the meaning of
section 116(2)(d)
. The answer to that, we are satisfied, is ""Yes, he was."" We reject any submission that there is a relevant semantic distinction between ""cannot be found"" and ""cannot be contacted"". This witness could not be found at the material time, which was the Monday morning of the trial.
11.
That leads on to the question which really matters for the purposes of
section 116
which is whether he could not be found ""although such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him have been taken."" The evidence was as follows. The case had been fixed at the case management hearing for 15th January. At some point in September the witness, Mr Chambers, had been spoken to and confirmed that he was in a position to attend. It looks as if that was done by a telephone call. Quite why it was not done until September when the fixed date had been given in July we do not know. We observe in passing that that kind of passage of time has the potential to cause problems. Witnesses may move. If this is symptomatic of the usual practice, it is not good enough. It runs the real risk that a witness may not be found when if prompt contact with him had been made he would have been. It was not, however, the occasion of the problem in this case because he was contacted in September and he was able to confirm that he would attend. However, after whatever conversation there was in September, nothing had then been done until the Friday before the trial was due to start on the Monday. That is to say, the last working day. On the Friday all that happened was that the witness was telephoned on his mobile telephone. He did not answer but there was a voicemail service. A message was left on his mobile telephone. At the trial the officer in the case, who was asked to give evidence about all this, was unable to say who it was who had made the telephone call to the answering service, except that as he understood it, it would be ""someone from the witness care unit of the local authority"". There being no reply to whatever message was left on the mobile telephone, and there was no evidence what the message exactly said, nothing else was done whatever. On Monday morning a further attempt was made to telephone by the officer in the case himself but contact could not be established.
12.
The evidence given to the Recorder was that this system was described, apparently amongst those who operate it, as a system of ""overnight call warning"". We do not want to speculate on precisely what that means, but if it means that it is thought to be sufficient to leave a message the night before a witness is due to attend, we desire to say as emphatically as we can that it will not do. The Recorder was in this case persuaded that such steps as were reasonably practicable to take to find the witness had been taken. For the Crown, Mr Alabi invites us to consider that there was no real reason to suppose at any time before the Monday morning of the trial that the witness was not going to come, even although on the Friday he had not been answering his mobile telephone.
13.
With both of those propositions we respectfully but emphatically disagree. What happened in this case was a very long way short of what is in practice needed to get witnesses to come to court. All the experience of the criminal courts demonstrates that witnesses are not invariably organised people with settled addresses who respond promptly to letters and telephone calls and who manage their calendars with precision. They often do not much want to come to court. If they are willing they may not accord the appointment the high priority that it needs. Even if they do both of those things, it is only too foreseeable that something may intervene either to push the matter out of their minds or to cause a clash of commitments. Holidays, work, move of house, illness of self or relative and commitments within the family are just simple examples of the kind of considerations which day in, day out, lead to witnesses not according the obligation to appear at court the priority that they ought to do. We are told that in the present case it turned out that Mr Chambers had taken his wife to hospital. If he had to do that, and it may be he did, that should have been found out at the very least the previous week and then consideration could have been given to whether the trial had to go back or whether alternative arrangements could be made to get the lady to hospital, or whether the trial could start a little later in the day, or some other adjustment made to enable the process of justice to take place. All of that was simply rendered impossible by the wholly inadequate approach of those whose duty it was to keep in touch with the witness. It may very well be that, however regrettably, the police are no longer able themselves to undertake the care of prospective witnesses. That is not a matter on which it is right for us to express any view. But whoever it is who does undertake it, the need to keep in touch, to be alive to the witness's needs and commitments is not less now than it ever was; if anything it is rather greater now than it used to be. Leaving contact with the witness such as this until the last working day before the trial is not good enough and it certainly is not such steps as it is reasonably practicable to take to find him. In addition to that, once the message was not known to have been received on the Friday and there was doubt about it, we agree with Mr Lynn that reasonably practicable steps which ought to have been taken included a visit to his address and/or to his place of work or agency, or at least contact with those places, perhaps by telephone.
14.
We do not doubt the general proposition which is contained in passing in
R v Coughlan
[1999] EWCA Crim. 553 that a relevant consideration for the question of what reasonable steps are practicable is the resources of the police or whoever it is who undertakes witness care on their behalf. But nothing that we have suggested in this case would be particularly expensive in terms of resource and it is to be observed that the case to which we have been referred for that proposition is another case in which absolutely nothing had been done to keep in touch with a relevant witness.
15.
For all those reasons we are perfectly satisfied that this evidence was not admissible under
section 116(2)(d)
. That leads us on to the next question which is whether, if not, was it admissible in any event under section 114(1)(d) on the basis that it was in the interests of justice for it to be admitted. The Recorder did not directly address section 114(1)(d) but in the course of her consideration of the application she did address the factors which are relevant to admissibility under 114(1)(d) namely those which are found in section 114(2). It rather looks as if she did that because the application was dealt with on the footing that those 114(2) factors were relevant to the 116 application. In fact they are not.
Section 116
says that if the various different circumstances or conditions which are there set out exist, the statement
is
admissible, subject only to the Court's power to exclude it under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, that is to say on the basis that it would render the proceedings unfair, or under
section 126
of
the 2003 Act
on the grounds that if it were admitted it would occasion an undue waste of time insufficiently balanced by the case for admitting it.
16.
That said, however, the Recorder's enquiry into the section 114(2) factors, together with her very proper concern that practical justice should properly be done to both sides in this case, led her to enquire in the course of this application what the real issue in the case was. She was absolutely right to make that enquiry. Courts are and should be increasingly concerned to identify the issues in a case and to focus the trial upon them. It is one of the underlying principles of the Criminal Procedure Rules that both the court
and all parties
have an obligation to do so.
17.
This defendant was under a statutory obligation to lodge a defence case statement - the obligation is created by section 5 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act. Such a defence case statement is required among other things to identify the matters of fact on which he takes issue with the Crown, that is to say to identify the issues - see section 6(1)(b). This defendant had lodged no defence case statement at all. No excuse, reasonable or otherwise, for that failure has ever been suggested. He had, however, at the case management hearing which we have mentioned, through counsel, said in court and on the form which was completed to record what had happened, that he would ""consider"" a plea to simple possession. That statement could only have been made on the defendant's instructions. Those two factors (the absence of the defence case statement and what had been said at the management hearing) led the Recorder to enquire in the course of argument from counsel what the issue was. Counsel rightly chose his words carefully. The Recorder at one point asked this question:
""Are you now telling me that in fact he is now going to say to the jury that he was not in possession?
Answer (from counsel): No, I am not saying that.""
A little later, counsel, again rightly and properly, told the Recorder:
""As your Honour says, he has always accepted that he was in possession of the drugs.""
That identification of the issue, belated as it was, was proper and it was quite sufficient to demonstrate that it was in the interests of justice for Mr Chambers' witness statement to be read at least providing it was edited, as it was, to remove from it anything that was contentious. The reality was that the true issue in this case was whether an intent to supply was proved or not.
18.
We ought to make clear that we do not reach that conclusion on the basis simply of what was said at the plea and case management hearing about the possibility of a plea of guilty to possession. We reach it because what had there been said was in fact entirely consistent with the defendant's case and with what the issue actually was. Whether the terms of what was said at the case management hearing were a sufficient admission of possession to be proved is, as it seems to us, a moot point. It will depend very much on exactly what is said and on the circumstances of each case and each case needs individual examination. At one end of the scale a hypothetical discussion between counsel or an enquiry of counsel for the Crown ""Would the Crown accept a plea to such and such if it were offered"" is clearly not an admission which could be proved against the defendant. At the other end, a plea of guilty in open court certainly is. In
R v Hayes
[2005] Cr.App.R 33
at 557, a letter from solicitors advancing a plea to a lesser count was also held to be admissible at least for the purposes of cross-examination to contradict contrary evidence given at the trial. Whether a suggestion of a plea at a case management hearing is or is not a provable admission or is or is not a safe basis for identifying what the issue is will vary from case to case. We do not need to explore that in the present case because of the other material which plainly identified the issue for the Recorder. Moreover, what the Recorder had properly been told once she enquired into what the issue was, was in due course confirmed in the trial. The defendant gave evidence. His case was that the drugs had indeed been in his trouser pocket. He gave an explanation for their being there. His explanation was that there had been some kind of scuffle or altercation in the club and at the end of it he had spotted a matchbox on the floor, he had picked it up to enquire of the people near him whether they had dropped it, no one claimed it so he tucked it away in his pocket and thought no more of it. That was his explanation for his possession of the drugs. If the jury accepted it, it no doubt meant that the intent to supply had not been proved. Those clearly were the defendant's instructions. That was his case. It would be quite wrong for us to assume that his case had changed when Mr Chambers' witness statement was admitted and the exchanges which we have already mentioned demonstrate otherwise.
19.
All that confirms that the true issue in the case was not possession but intent to supply. That in turn means that it was plainly in the interests of justice for the uncontentious matter of possession to be proved by the Crown by the admission of the edited witness statement of Mr Chambers. To hold otherwise would not be to do justice; it would rather be to afford a defendant an escape on purely technical grounds. Mr Lynn would submit that to admit the evidence is to reverse the burden of proof in a criminal case. That submission, we are satisfied, is wrong. There is no question of relieving the Crown of the duty of proving the essential elements of the case. The question is not whether it is for the Crown to prove it, but how the Crown shall be permitted to prove it. If parts of the Crown's evidence are in dispute, it is quite likely that it will not be in the interests of justice to permit those parts to be proved by the reading of a hearsay statement when the witness cannot be cross-examined and properly challenged. But if parts of the Crown's case are not in dispute then it is plainly in the interests of justice that those parts shall be permitted to be proved by them by means of the hearsay statement as in this case.
20.
We have had regard also to Mr Lynn's proper but perhaps rather faint submission that there was potential for injustice because he might have wanted to cross-examine the security guard as to what he had been told by other people in the club with a view to seeing whether that confirmed that there had been or might have been some kind of scuffle of the kind that the defendant was asserting. That was not a suggestion which was made to the Recorder and with all respect we do not regard it as realistic. Enquiry into what the security guard had been told by other people would in any event be asking a question which could only be answered by hearsay evidence. Quite apart from that in the present case any enquiry as to what the security guard had been told by others was most unlikely to be asked. If his original statement was right what he had been told by others was that the defendant had been seen putting his hand down his trousers as if to field the drugs which, according to the security guard, had been found there.
21.
It follows from all those reasons that although we are satisfied that the Recorder erred in holding that such steps as were reasonably practicable to take had been taken to find Mr Chambers and thus in finding that the statement could be read under
section 116(2)(d)
, it is plain that the statement was admissible under section 114(1)(d). In those circumstances this conviction is not arguably unsafe. For those reasons this appeal against conviction is dismissed.","citation:

Judgment
Mr Justice Simon:
1.
On 16 October 2008 at Sheffield Crown Court, this Appellant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine (as an alternative to an offence charged under count 1, possession with intent), and to a charge of acquiring criminal property (count 2).
2.
On 27 October he was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment on count 1 and a consecutive term of 3 years imprisonment on count 2. The sentence on count 2 was later varied to a term of 2 years and 9 months, in the light of further information made available to the Court about the value of the criminal property. It follows that the overall term to be served was a term of 3 years and 3 months.
3.
He had committed these offences before the expiry of the full term of an earlier sentence of imprisonment; and in these circumstances, he was also ordered to be returned to custody to serve 455 days of the remaining period, pursuant to
s.116 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000
(‘the PCC(S)A 2000’)
4.
He appeals against sentence with the leave of the Full Court.
5.
In order to understand the first ground of appeal it is necessary to consider the circumstances in which the Appellant was ordered to be returned to custody and to serve 455 days of the earlier sentence.
6.
On 17 December 2003 at Sheffield Crown Court the Appellant had been sentenced to a term of 7 years imprisonment for possession of heroin with intent to supply. We will refer to this offence as ‘the earlier offence’.
7.
He was released on licence from this sentence on 22 June 2007, with a sentence expiry date of 22 June 2010. He committed the two index offences on 25 January 2008. Since the earlier offence was committed before the coming into force of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
(‘CJA 2003), his release was subject to the early release provision of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
and to the supplementary provisions of the PCC(S)A 2000.
8.
Section 116(1)
of the PCC(S)A 2000 provided (in short summary) that, (a) where a sentence was passed on an offender on or after 1 October 1992, (b) he was released under the early release provisions in Part II of the CJA 1991, (c) he committed an offence before the date by which he would have served his sentence but for his early release, and (d) was convicted of the new offence, a Court could (under ss.(2)) order his return to prison to complete the sentence; and could direct (under ss.(6)) that the period be served before the sentence for the new offence. In effect, the Court could pass a sentence for the new offence which took effect consecutively to any period of recall ordered.
9.
With effect from 4 April 2005, s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000 was repealed by
s.332 of the CJA
2003 Act and Part 7 of Schedule 37. However, the effect of paragraph 29 of schedule 2 to the Commencement No.8 and Transitional and Savings Provisions Order 2005 was that s.116 continued to apply where the earlier sentence was imposed for an offence committed before 4 April 2005, even where the new offence was committed after that date. Paragraph 29 is conveniently set out in 2009 Edition of Archbold at 5-364n, and expressly states that the repeal of s.116 of
the 2000 Act
,
… is of no effect in relation to a person in a case in which the sentence of imprisonment referred to in s.116(1)(a) of the
Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act 2000
- (a) is imposed in respect of an offence committed before 4 April 2005
10.
Mr Longworth (on the Appellant’s behalf) accepted this analysis but draws attention to
s.265 of the CJA
2003 and to the amendments made to it by
s.20(4) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008
(‘the CJIA 2008’), which came into force on 14 July 2008 by virtue of paragraph 10 of
Schedule 1 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008
(Commencement No.2 and Transitional and Saving Provision). He submitted that s.20(4) of the CJIA 2008 effectively repealed s.116 PCC(S)A 2000.
11.
Section 265(1) of the CJA
2003 provides:
A court sentencing a person to a term of imprisonment may not order or direct that the term is to commence on the expiry of any other sentence of imprisonment for which he has been released under this Chapter.
These provisions reproduce s.84 of the PCC(S)A 2000. It follows that just as s.84 was, they are entirely consistent with the continued operation of s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000.
Section 116(7)
explicitly says so.
As a consequence of subsection (6)(a) above, the court shall not be prevented by
section 265 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
(restriction on consecutive sentences for released prisoners) from making any direction authorised by subsection 6(b) above
12.
Section 20
of the CJIA 2008 introduced changes to
s.265 of the CJA
2003; and s.20(4) of the 2008 Act provided for a new subsection to s.265 of
the 2003 Act
. The new subsection 265(1A)is in these terms:
Subsection (1) applies to a court sentencing a person to
(a) a term of imprisonment for an offence committed before 4 April 2005
... as it applies to the imposition of any other term of imprisonment
13.
Mr Longworth argued that this had the effect of bringing to an end the power under the transitional provisions to order a defendant to return to prison to serve out the remainder of an earlier sentence before serving the sentence for the index offence, which had been reserved in cases where the earlier offence had been committed before 4 April 2005. He relied on paragraph 11 of the Explanatory Notes to the CJIA 2008 which are in the following terms.
... This section also amends
the 2003 Act
to clarify the position on imposing consecutive sentences on different occasions. If an offender has been released on licence after serving all the required custodial periods then a subsequent sentence may not be ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence from which he has been released.
14.
He submitted that the phrase ‘a term of imprisonment’ in the new s.265(1A) of the CJA 2003 has the same meaning as it does in 116(6)(a) of the PCC(S)A 2000, so that the Judge when he made the recall order was thus imposing a sentence of imprisonment in respect of an offence. Section 265(1A) of the CJA 2003 Act (as amended by CJIA 2008) should be construed as repealing s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000, so that it has no effect whether the old offence was committed before or after 4 April 2005; or at least, if the power to order recall remained, the power in s.116(6) to make a new sentence consecutive to it was repealed. He further submitted that it would be arbitrary and unfair to interpret s.265(1A) of CJA 2003 as allowing a court to order a defendant to return to prison to serve out the remainder of the sentence only for offences for which the old sentence was passed before 4 April 2005.
15.
Attractively as the points were argued we are not persuaded that the intent of the CJIA 2008 was to repeal the transitional provisions which had previously applied or to deprive them of effect in a case such as this.
16.
Section 265(1A) of the amended CJA 2003 does not deal with the Court’s powers under s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000. For the reasons explained in [11] above, it is perfectly compatible with the powers given by s.116 both to order recall and to make the new sentence start after the recall period. Section 265 prevents a new sentence from starting after another sentence from which there has been release
except
where there is an order for recall under
section 116
.
17.
The Explanatory Note to s.20 of the CJIA 2008 needs to be read in the context of its stated intent:
1 ... These explanatory notes ... have been prepared by the Ministry of Justice in order to assist the reader of the Act and to help inform debate on it. They do not form part of the Act and have not been endorsed by Parliament.
2 The notes need to be read in conjunction with the Act. They are not, and are not meant to be, a comprehensive description of the Act. So where a section does not seem to require any explanation or comment, none is given.
18.
If the statutory intent was to prevent a term of recall to prison having to be served before a subsequent sentence was imposed in every case, then it would have been easy enough explicitly to express such intent. However it is clear from Schedule 26 of the CJIA 2008 that there was no statutory intent to repeal s.116 so far as it still had transitional effect. Paragraph 40 of Schedule 26 (which deals with minor and consequential amendments) reads,
The
Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000
has effect subject to the following amendments.
Paragraph 45 reads,
In
section 116
(the power to order a return to prison where offence committed during original sentence) –
a)
In subsection (1)(b) for ‘under Part II of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
(early release prisoners)’ substitute ‘under an provision of
Part 2
of the
Criminal Justice Act 1991
(early release of prisoners) other than s.33(1A)’
b)
In subsection (7) for ‘s.84 above’ substitute ‘
s.265 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003)
restriction on consecutive sentences for released prisoners’.
19.
As we have already noted above, subparagraph (b) means that
section 116(7)
of the PCC(S)A now reads:
As a consequence of subsection 6(a) above, the court shall not be prevented by
section 265 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
from making any direction authorised by subsection 6(b) above
That expressly preserves the power in s 116(6)(b) to order the new sentence to begin after a period of recall which is ordered.
20.
However, the effect of subparagraph (a), taken with other provisions of the CJIA 2008, especially s.26, is that s.116 does not now apply to long term (4 years or more) 1991 Act prisoners who are released under the new
section 33
(1A) at the half-way point in their sentence (bringing them into line with CJA 2003 prisoners). But
section 116
does still apply to two types of 1991 Act prisoners, who are outside the new
section 33
(1A):
i)
if one or more of the offences were a specified violent or sexual offence within the meaning of
Schedule 15 of the CJA
2003, or
ii)
if the offender were released on licence under the provisions of the CJA 1991 (in other words before 9 June 2008 when Schedule 26
Part 2
paragraph 45 of the 2008 Act came into force) (see the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (Commencement No.1 and Transitional Provisions Order)
[SI 1466 of 2008]
21.
It appears that the purpose of s.20 of the CJIA 2008 is at least related to s.26 which effected a change in the early release provisions in relation to those serving long-term sentences to which the CJA 1991 applied. We should add that in our view Archbold 2009 Ed. 3
rd
Supplement 5-364r correctly sets out the present ambit of s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000.
22.
So far as the present case is concerned, the Appellant was released from his sentence for an earlier offence on 22 June 2007 under the provisions of the CJA 1991; and in these circumstances it was open to the Court to return the Appellant to prison under s.116 under the amended transitional provisions.
23.
We would also add that we do not see any arbitrariness or unfairness in the continued application of s.116 in the confined circumstances in which it may still apply. As Mr Longworth recognised, it may well be that underlying the repeal of s.116 is an assumption that recall from licence will be dealt with by administrative powers. It is to be observed that in this case, where the repeal of s.116 did not apply, the Appellant was not recalled administratively.
24.
In considering the other grounds of appeal it is necessary to consider the facts of the two offences for which the Appellant was sentenced on 27 October 2008.
25.
On 25 January 2008 the police conducted a search at the Appellant’s home and found £12,000 in cash. It was accepted that £2,000 of this sum was the legitimate property of the Appellant’s partner and this was returned to her. The police also recovered 56 grams of cocaine which was later found to be of 6% purity. According to the Defence Expert’s evidence it had a wholesale value of £800 and a street value of £1,680. In interview the Appellant said that the cocaine was for his own use and that he had purchased it for £1,000. The Prosecution accepted the Defence contention that the cocaine was not crack-cocaine and that its value was consistent with what the Appellant had said (in interview) that he had paid for it. The sum of money which was attributable to the Appellant as criminal property was accepted as £8,000. There was no evidence or admission as to the ultimate source of this sum.
26.
The Appellant, who is now aged 32, had 13 previous convictions for 20 offences; the most recent of which was the conviction for possession of heroin with intent (to which we have already referred).
27.
A number of points are raised in relation to the sentence, but it is convenient to focus on two: (1) the order that the Appellant serve 455 days of the unexpired sentence imposed for the earlier offence was unexplained and failed to take into account the time he had spent in custody; and (2) the overall sentence was too long in the light of his pleas of guilty, and, looking at the sentence of 2 years and 9 months for money laundering in isolation, the sentence was significantly too long in the light of his plea.
28.
So far as the first point is concerned, the expiry date for the earlier offence was 5 September 2010 and the offences for which he was sentenced were committed on 25 January 2008. It follows that the period he was ‘at risk’ of being returned to prison ran from 25 January 2008 until 5 September 2010 (954 days). In fact, as we have recorded, the period ordered to be served was 455 days. It is unclear why this period was chosen. The Appellant had been on remand from 26 January until 27 October 2008 (a period of 275 days); and the Judge should therefore have made a direction under s.240 of
the 2003 Act
. He did not do so; and in those circumstances we proceed on the basis that the Appellant was entitled to be credited with 275 days against the sentence imposed.
29.
In these circumstances we direct that the Appellant be returned to prison under s.116 of the PCC(S)A 2000 Act for a period 455 days.
30.
So far as the second point is concerned, we are not persuaded that there was anything wrong with the sentence of 6 months on count 1 in the light of the Appellant’s antecedent history. Nor do we accept that the sentences should be ordered to be served concurrently, since there was nothing from the Appellant (who would have been in the best position to know) to suggest that the money laundering offence was linked to the drugs offence. However we accept that as a matter of totality the overall sentence of 3 years and 3 months, giving full credit for the plea as the Judge said he had done, was too long as a matter of totality. In these circumstances we quash the sentence of 2 years 9 months and substitute a sentence of 2 years on count 2. The overall sentence will therefore be a term of 2 years and 6 months, and we direct that the 275 days spent on remand should count against that sentence.
31.
To this extent only, the appeal is allowed.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: The Attorney-General seeks the leave of the Court, under
section 36
of the
Criminal Justice Act 1988
, to refer a sentence said to be unduly lenient. We grant leave.
2.
The offender is 38 years of age, having been born in January 1966. On 7th January 2004 he pleaded guilty to an offence of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug of Class A, namely crack cocaine, to another and also to three offences of supplying crack cocaine on one occasion and heroin on two occasions. He was sentenced by His Honour Judge Holloway at Liverpool Crown Court on 12th January 2004 to 5 months' imprisonment on each offence to run concurrently.
3.
The circumstances were that Operation Manton targeted those involved in the supply of Class A drugs in the centre of the city of Liverpool. Such supply in that city is well-known to this Court to be a matter of considerable concern. The operation involved the use of undercover police officers acting as test purchasers. Other officers using concealed equipment to record potentially incriminating conversation and other officers engaged on surveillance duties. The offences to which the offender pleaded guilty spanned a period of about a month from the end of May to the end of June 2003.
4.
In each of the four supplies the person supplied was an undercover officer known as 'Sam'. The first count related to 104 milligrams supplied on 29th May. The offender was selling the Big Issue magazine. He was approached by the officer whom he asked if he was looking for Jed and he told the officer that Jed had been locked up the previous night. There was a subsequent meeting when a discussion between the two of them took place, involving the possibility of the officer and the offender pooling their money in order to buy drugs. Thereafter the officer returned several times to speak to the offender and to discuss whether sufficient money was to hand.
5.
The offender asked the officer whether he wanted 'white', which was a reference to cocaine, or 'brown', which was a reference to heroin and the officer said 'white'. Later that day the offender made a couple of telephone calls and soon afterwards a male arrived on a bicycle, approaching the offender and he gave the name 'Twinny'. It was clear to the undercover officer that the offender and 'Twinny' knew each other. The offender handed over £13 in cash and the officer handed £8 in cash to 'Twinny' in exchange for a bag of white substance. 'Twinny' asked the officer why he had only got £8 and the officer said he had thought that he and the offender were going in it together. The purity of that crack was high: it was 86%.
6.
Count 2 related to 141 milligrams of heroin on 5th June 2003. There was another meeting between the officer and the offender outside a McDonald's restaurant. The offender eventually made a telephone call to 'Twinny'. Three other males, together with the offender and the undercover officer, caught a bus in order to rendez vous with 'Twinny'. After they had alighted from the bus the undercover officer handed £10 to the offender and when 'Twinny' arrived, the offender handed him a quantity of money in exchange for a number of cellophane bags, two of which, containing a white substance, were handed to the offender and there were also three bags containing brown powder, two of which the offender handed to one of the other males, and one of which he handed to the undercover police officer. The purity of that heroin was low: it was only 20%.
7.
Count 3 related to supplying 107 milligrams of crack cocaine on 9th June. A little after midnight on 9th June the undercover officer spoke to the offender, who was in the company of another man referred to as 'Beard' and the officer arranged to buy a bag of 'white'. In that connection he took a bus with the offender and 'Beard' to another part of the city. During the journey the offender was handed money by 'Beard' and £10 by the officer.
8.
Shortly after reaching their destination, the offender made a telephone call and, within a very short time, the offender, who had met whoever had come from the dealer, handed the officer a bag of 'white' substance which was of 77% purity.
9.
Count 4 related to supplying 137 milligrams of heroin on 23rd June. On that occasion the officer met the offender and 'Beard' and asked the offender if he could supply a bag of 'brown'. The offender said that it would cost £10. The officer tried to barter, but the offender said that on this occasion he had no money.
10.
Later that day, the officer met the offender and 'Beard'. The offender made a telephone call. The three men took a bus to another part of Liverpool and there a further telephone call was made by the offender. At that stage, the officer handed £10 to the offender. Within minutes 'Twinny' appeared, to whom the offender handed a quantity of cash and received three bags in exchange, one of which contained brown powder which he handed to the officer. The offender asked 'Twinny' whether he was doing his job right by bringing the punters up, to which 'Twinny's' response was that the offender was ""just doing it to get his freebies"". That heroin was of 28% purity.
11.
The offender was arrested somewhat later, on 16th October 2003. In interview, he said that he was addicted to heroin and cocaine and had been using drugs since 1987. He used four or five bags a day, costing £30 or £40, which he funded by begging and selling copies of the Big Issue. He said he bought drugs on behalf of many people and, in consequence, would get a discount from the dealer by purchasing in bulk. For example, two rocks of crack would cost £15 but three rocks £20. Sometimes, rather than merely getting a discount, he would get his drugs free.
12.
The prosecution conceded, at the hearing before the trial judge, that the offences involved a pooling of resources by the offender and the undercover officer, which amounted to facilitating the acquisition of drugs for the officer. But, the prosecution said, there was a slight benefit by way of discount accruing to the offender.
13.
On behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr Rees draws attention to three aggravating features. First, four offences were committed over a period of about a month. Secondly, two of the offences took place during a period of two concurrent conditional discharges which had been imposed on the offender for quite different offences. Thirdly, the offender has recent previous convictions for possessing Class A drugs.
14.
Mr Rees draws attention to three mitigating factors. First, the quantities supplied were small. Secondly, the offender was clearly something less than a commercial dealer of the kind commonly encountered in cases such as this and was acting so as to reduce the cost of drugs to himself. Thirdly, Mr Rees points out that the offender not only pleaded guilty to all the offences, but fully admitted what he had been doing and did so frankly in the course of interview.
15.
The submission which is made is that the sentence of 5 months passed by the learned judge (deliberately passed, it should be mentioned, rather than a 6 month sentence to ensure that the offender who had been in custody was immediately released) was unduly lenient in failing to take into account adequately the gravity of the offence, the need to deter others and public concern about offences of this kind.
16.
Mr Rees drew attention to four authorities in particular. In
Attorney-General Reference No 84 of 2000
[2001] 2 Cr App R(S) 336, this Court, increasing a sentence passed in the court below, indicated that, on a guilty plea, for supplying crack to a police officer, a sentence of 4 or 5 years might properly be expected in the ordinary case of commercial supply. Mr Rees also drew attention to
R v Patel
[1998] 1 Cr App R(S) 170 and
R v Denslow
[1998] Crim LR 566, of the judgment in which, on 6th February 1998, the Court has been provided with a transcript. Mr Rees also drew attention to
R v Rumble
[2003] 1 Cr App R(S) 618, where a sentence of 3 years was reduced to 2, on a guilty plea, in relation to the supply of ecstasy without a commercial motive.
17.
Mr Travers, on behalf of the offender, placed reliance before the learned judge and sought to place reliance before this Court on the case of
Denslow
. That, it is to be noted, was an appeal against conviction, the appellant having been given an absolute discharge. The court concluded that, in the light of a decision of this Court in
R v Buckley and Lane
69 Cr App R, the appellant was technically guilty of an offence of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply.
18.
In the course of giving the judgment of the Court, Mantell LJ questioned why it was thought necessary to charge supply, in the circumstances of that case, bearing in mind that a plea had been offered to a charge of possession which, in the view of the Court, ought to have been accepted.
19.
As Mr Travers rightly accepts, the circumstances of
Denslow
, which clearly had a considerable impact upon the sentencing judge in the present case, were conspicuously different from those in the present case. In particular,
Denslow
had possession of the relevant drug on only one occasion. As is apparent from what we have already said, this offender was involved in the supply of drugs on four occasions, spread out over a period of a month. Therefore, as it seems to us, this was plainly not a case of mere technical guilt of the offences to which he pleaded guilty.
20.
We would have expected, in the light of the authorities and the particular circumstances of this case, that a sentence of the order of 18 months to 2 years would have been passed on this offender in the court below.
21.
The question which then arises, however, on the basis that the sentence passed in the court below was unduly lenient, is whether this Court should interfere. We have concluded that we should not, for a number reasons. First, when regard is had to the principle of double jeopardy, that is to say that the offender is being sentenced a second time, whatever sentence ought to have been passed in the court below would inevitably have to be discounted in this Court. Furthermore, bearing in mind that the offender, by reason of the sentence passed by the Crown Court judge was immediately released, if this Court were now to increase the sentence, he would have to return to prison. That aspect calls for a further discount from the sentence which would have been appropriate in the court below.
22.
Next, it is apparent, so far as this offender is concerned, that he has done well in the 4 months since he was released. There is before us a reference from the community network which runs the hostel at which he has lived since 16th February. It is apparent that the offender is making positive moves in controlling his drug habit. He is attending the drug dependency unit in Liverpool, receiving counselling and support, and he is working diligently on a market garden project at the hostel. Furthermore, he has provided great assistance to the manager of the hostel in relation to another resident there who has been seriously ill.
23.
Having regard to those matters, it would not be appropriate, in the exercise of our discretion, to interfere with the sentence which was passed on the offender.
24.
Two further matters merit comment. First of all, lest anyone should think otherwise, the unduly lenient sentence which was passed by the learned Crown Court judge was not based in any way at all on any assistance which some people might think that the offender had given to the police. There has been no such assistance and the sentence was erroneously based upon the decision of this Court in
Denslow
and was not due to any perceived credit for other matters.
25.
The final matter which is of considerable significance is this. The sentence which was passed upon the offender resulted from a major operation by the police in Operation Manton. We have been told that, so far, the same judge has passed sentence on 43 defendants of whom this offender is but one. All that we know, in relation to those other defendants, is that the range of sentences which he has imposed has been between 18 months and five-and-a-half years' imprisonment. It is apparent that the learned sentencing judge regarded this offender as being in a wholly exceptional category, compared with others who had appeared before him. We have no details in relation to those other 43 defendants. But it is a matter of significance when this Court is invited to interfere with a sentence said to be unduly lenient, that the sentence passed was not in isolation in respect to a particular defendant but in the context of many other defendants being sentenced by the same judge in relation to the same or similar activity. That makes the task of this Court extremely difficult if called upon to interfere with one out of so many sentences.
26.
For the reasons which we hope we have adequately explained, although the sentence was unduly lenient, we do not interfere with it.","citation:

MR JUSTICE FREEDMAN:
1.
This is an appeal against sentence brought with the leave of the single judge.
2.
On 27 February 2019, in the Crown Court at Basildon, the Appellant was sentenced to 7 ½ years' imprisonment for an offence of aggravated burglary, contrary to section 10(1) of the Theft Act 1968, to which he had pleaded guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing.
3.
On 6 August 2018, at about 11:00am, the victim was at home by herself. She was upstairs in the family home. She saw at the front door a person she believed to be a postman wearing a red hat with a Royal Mail logo on it. He indicated that a letter needed to be signed for. She opened the door. He barged through, put his hand over her mouth and forced her onto the ground in the porch. She struggled with him and struggled to breathe. She tried to scream and to kick. Two other men stepped over her and entered the house. She was pulled to her feet and passed to one of the intruders who threw her onto a sofa. She was told to shut up and to be quiet. A pillow or cushion was held over her head, face down. She could hear the other men walking around upstairs. They were apparently looking for something. She was marched upstairs and pushed into her own bedroom. One man ripped a panel off the bath. She was pushed into her parents' bedroom and then into the box room. She saw two of the men coming down from the attic. She was taken downstairs and there was a discussion about the shed. In the extension she was told to face the wall and to shut up. One man took two cable ties from his pocket which he used to bind her wrists behind her back. She thought that she was to be kidnapped, because the ""postman"" had a sheet. She was told to stay put. The men ran off. Within a minute, she freed herself. The incident lasted about ten minutes.
2
4.
A neighbour saw three men approach and go to a silver works van. She took a videorecording on her mobile. The van belonged to the Appellant. It had been bought from DEFRA and a tracker device remained operational. The van was abandoned at a football ground at about 11:45am that same morning.
5.
The Appellant was arrested the following evening as he was about to board a flight to Malta. He first claimed that he had sold the vehicle two days earlier, until he was shown a picture of him filling it up with fuel on the day of the offence. Thereafter, he declined to comment in interview.
6.
His case was that he was outside throughout, but part of a joint enterprise. Even if the plan had been to enter the property once the victim's father had left, the burglary continued, even when it was apparent that the home was plainly occupied, as the wearing of the postman's hat makes plain.
7.
The victim sustained grazes to her back and shoulder. Nerve damage to one foot has led to the loss of feeling. In her Victim Personal Statement, among other things, she explains her consequential severe anxiety and her time off work as a police constable due to worry and stress. She cannot be alone at home for fear of another attack. Her sleep is affected and she worries about going out at night.
8.
In seeking to minimise the impact of the Victim Personal Statement, it was suggested on the Appellant's behalf that improper pressure may have been applied on the victim by a colleague in connection with that statement. There is no evidence at all to support that suggestion and we
reject it.
9.
The Appellant is aged 32. He has previous convictions. His last sentence for theft led to a sentence of 23 months' imprisonment in 2011. In 2008 he was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for taking motor vehicles without consent.
10.
In his sentencing remarks the judge rejected the submission that this was a Category 2 case on the basis of lesser harm and higher culpability. It was Category 1 on the basis of greater harm and higher culpability. The victim's problems were ongoing and likely to remain so. Greater harm was established by her significant psychological injury, physical injury and the fact that the offence was committed in her home. Factors indicating higher culpability were: a significant degree of planning, the house was targeted, and it was a group attack.
11.
The starting point within the sentencing guidelines was 10 years' custody, with a range of 9 to 13 years. For this extremely serious aggravated burglary, the starting point of 11 years was appropriate, before any reduction for mitigation or guilty plea. The Appellant's mitigation was that in prison he had undertaken courses and had aided and assisted others. There were no recent previous convictions. The judge thus reduced 11 years to 10 years to reflect the Appellant's progress. A discount of 25 per cent for a guilty plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing further reduced the term to 7 ½ years' imprisonment.
12.
This morning the appellant repeats his argument as to category. Even if the offending fell into category 1, he says, it was at the lower part of the scale. He argues that the only indicator of greater harm was that the victim was at home and was moved around during the search. He argues that too much emphasis was placed on this. The burglary was committed over a relatively brief period during which the intruders were plainly more interested in finding something, rather than in the victim.
Conclusion
13.
This argument ignores the terrifying nature of the victim's ordeal and its consequences, which justified the judge's view that this was a Category 1 case. The alternative submission that even if the offending fell into Category 1, the starting point should be in the lower part is hopeless, as the judge's careful analysis makes plain. Indeed, it was generous to allow a reduction of 1 year to reflect progress in prison over a few months prior to sentence.
14.
There is nothing in the points raised before this court. This appeal against sentence is therefore dismissed.

1.
LORD JUSTICE DAVIS: The Solicitor General seeks to challenge sentences on the grounds that they are unduly lenient. We grant leave in this case. There are three offenders concerned: Paul Lamb (now aged 53), David Lamb (now aged 51) and James Lamb, son of Paul Lamb (now aged 27).
2.
The three offenders had been charged with attempted murder and in the alternative wounding with intent, contrary to
section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861
. In addition, James Lamb had been charged with two counts of having an article with a blade or point and Paul Lamb had been charged with one count to like effect.
3.
At a plea and a trial preparation hearing on 14 February 2020 the offenders all entered pleas of not guilty in Newcastle Crown Court to counts 1 and 2. Paul Lamb also pleaded not guilty to count 5, being the count of having an article with a blade or point. James Lamb pleaded guilty to counts 3 and 4, being counts of having an article with a blade or point. A trial date was fixed for 6 July 2020, although that had to be vacated as a result of Covid impacts.
4.
On 18 September 2020, on the application of two of the offenders by way of seeking a
Goodyear
indication, there was a hearing before HHJ Adams in the Crown Court. The judge indicated that, unusually perhaps, as he said, he would be prepared to give a
Goodyear
indication in this particular case. Having done that, the judge indicated that the sentence would not exceed 11 years' imprisonment before personal mitigation was taken into account. On that day all of the offenders then pleaded guilty to count 2, being the alternative count of wounding with intent and Paul Lamb also pleaded guilty to count 5. The prosecution thereupon offered no evidence upon the count of attempted murder.
5.
On 27 November 2020 the offenders were each sentenced to 6 years 9 months' imprisonment on count 2 and various shorter concurrent sentences were imposed upon the other counts. The judge indicated in the course of his sentencing remarks, to which we will come, that he thought it appropriate that each offender should receive the same sentence.
6.
The background facts in essential summary are these. Paul Lamb and David Lamb were brothers and James Lamb, as we have said, was Paul Lamb's son. It seems plain that there had been something of a history between the three offenders and the victim of the attack, namely a man called Wayne Brown. The offenders maintained that Wayne Brown had a history of bullying David Lamb, involving physical violence and demands for money, moving into his house and so on. Further, it was stated that there had also been significant violence inflicted on others, including James Lamb. However, there was no basis of plea and the judge was not required to make any specific factual findings as to the full story by way of background; the judge nevertheless accepted that there had been significant background, involving bullying and assaults and so on the part of Wayne Brown.
7.
Just before 3 o'clock in the afternoon on Saturday 11 January 2020 Mr Brown had been in the company of David Lamb at an address in Gateshead, the home of a woman called Michelle Gibson. Others also had been visiting there. There was evidence that, at that stage, Wayne Brown appeared to have been bullying David Lamb within the property at the rear of the address and indeed then punched David Lamb. David Lamb is much smaller than Mr Brown. It was stated that the argument may have concerned money, said to be owed by David Lamb to Mr Brown, although his position was that no money
was in fact owed at all, rather it was simply being demanded by Mr Brown.
8.
At all events Mr Brown got much the better of David Lamb, repeatedly punching and kicking him. No weapons however were involved and Mr Brown then went back inside the house. David Lamb had then telephoned Paul Lamb; the result of which was that Paul Lamb, together with James Lamb, travelled to that address in their car, arriving quite soon after the telephone call had been made. They took with them two Samurai swords and a hunting knife. It was suggested, although no specific finding was made, that they had previously acquired those weapons as forms of defence against any prospective attacks by Mr Brown. At all events those were the weapons they took.
9.
On arrival at the address Mr Brown was then beckoned (most probably by David Lamb) into the rear yard. There he was then confronted by the offenders Paul and James Lamb, each of whom was in possession of a Samurai sword. As the judge found, those two would, at that stage, certainly have realised that Mr Brown was himself unarmed. The two then immediately began to attack Mr Brown with the swords, inflicting wounds as they did so. During the course of the attack the sword being used by the offender James Lamb buckled as it was being used to stab the victim. Having lost that sword James Lamb then returned to the vehicle to collect and arm himself with the knife (a form of hunting knife) and then, having returned, used it to inflict multiple deep penetrating wounds to the victim's neck.
10.
As for David Lamb, the evidence was that he did not himself physically participate in the fight; but there was evidence that he had encouraged Paul Lamb and James Lamb, knowing of course that they had weapons with them and that they were being used. At all events there was evidence, and it was accepted by the judge, that David Lamb was heard at one stage to shout: ""Best thing finish him off otherwise he'll come back and do us"" during the attack. Afterwards, the three left the scene. After returning home, they made attempts to conceal the weapons, although these were subsequently found.
11.
As for Mr Brown, he sustained life-threatening injuries. Indeed he suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to hospital and required intubation and surgery in the ambulance. He very nearly died. He required significant surgery. He lost his spleen. He was in intensive care for a number of days. The injuries had unquestionably been life threatening. He remained in a serious and unstable condition due to uncontrollable bleeding and was required to be returned for surgery on several occasions. He had to have a tracheotomy. Not only has he lost his spleen, but in addition there has been permanent scarring and also there is long-term restrictive movement in his left arm and he will constantly be on medication in the future. He had in fact required 37 units of blood and 37 units of plasma during his various surgical procedures. He continued a pattern of recovering and relapsing within the Intensive Care Unit until eventually removed from a ventilator on 11 February 2020 and being discharged from hospital on 18 February 2020. In his victim personal statement he also described the long-term psychological effects on him of the incident that day.
12.
Before the judge there were pre-sentence reports, and a psychological report so far as James Lamb was concerned. The overall assessment was that findings of dangerousness were not required.
13.
So far as David Lamb was concerned, the indications were that he had a significant number of problems; indeed he appears to have been an alcoholic at the time and needed care and there were various psychiatric issues so far as he was concerned.
14.
So far as the offender James Lamb was concerned, the psychological report referred to in effect his ""sensitive and vulnerable"" nature, to the fact that he had been driven in effect to the end of his tether by Mr Brown's previous conduct and, as the psychologist was to say, was ""in a very disturbed state of mind that day"". The impact of Mr Brown's previous behaviour on the offender Paul Lamb was in broadly similar terms.
15.
James Lamb has no previous convictions of any kind at all. Indeed the assessment was that what he did that day was wholly out of character. Paul Lamb does have a number of relatively old previous convictions but none involving violence and of no very great importance for present purposes. David Lamb unfortunately has many previous convictions, some involving violence: for example convictions for robbery, others involving burglary and the like.
16.
For the purposes of sentencing, the judge clearly had to have regard to the Definitive Guideline on Assault issued by the Sentencing Council. The judge was to accept, and it has not been disputed, that this s.18 assault was properly to be categorised as category 1 for the purposes of the guideline. So far as greater harm is concerned, here unquestionably there was injury which was serious in the context of the offence: the injuries had in fact been life threatening. Furthermore, as the judge was to find, there had also been a sustained or repeated assault on the victim. So far as factors indicating higher culpability was concerned, clearly here weapons had been used. The judge was to indicate there had been a degree of premeditation, but did not find that it was significant. A factor indicating lower culpability, and much pressed before the judge, was that here there was ""a greater degree of provocation than normally expected"". The judge of course was required to keep within the limits of his indication given at the previous
Goodyear
hearing.
17.
There was lengthy debate with counsel before the judge came to pass sentence. In the course of that debate Ms Hedworth, counsel appearing then as now for Paul Lamb, amongst other things, saw fit to say that she:
18.
""... do make a bold submission that this is a very unusual case... Your Honour will know that as from January of this year, any sentence imposed for [7] years would have the effect that the sentence imposed would not be half, it would be two-thirds served and I would invite perhaps your Honour to take that into account when determining what the appropriate length of sentence would be in this case.""
19.
Mr Knowles, counsel then as now appearing for James Lamb, also adopted that submission as part of his submission:
i.
""... I know your Honour will have in mind not only the impact of
Manning
[that is with regard to Covid] but also the recent changes to the sentencing regime.
ii.
[THE JUDGE]: We are not meant to have regard to that. The release provisions are of no concern to sentencing judges. iii.
MR KNOWLES: Of course they are not in terms of guidance that is proffered but one looks at it on the basis that this is a very unusual case.""
20.
We observe that before he came to pass sentence the judge said:
i.
""... just so that everyone is aware, it will be a sentence which is shorter than seven years.""
21.
When he passed sentence the judge dealt with the background facts very fully and thoroughly. So far as the mitigation by way of the asserted provocation was concerned, the judge accepted that there was:
i.
""a very significant background, going way back, a long way back before this day in question, on the day in question, David Lamb had clearly been assaulted ...""
22.
The judge indicated that the matter was within category 1: although of course there had to be a significant reduction for the provocation which he had found.
23.
The judge then indicated, as required by the guideline, what the starting point was to be. For category 1, the guideline stipulates a starting point of 12 years' custody with a category range of 9 to 16 years' custody. The judge took what is perhaps a slightly unusual approach, in that having taken a starting point of 12 years' custody, he then first went down significantly because of the factor indicating lower culpability, being a greater degree of provocation than normally expected. He then went up a little for other aggravating factors and then down again for other mitigation which he identified: ending up with a figure, before credit for plea of 20%, of eight-and-a-half years. Consequently and before giving credit for plea the judge's ending figure was a figure which was actually below the bottom of the range set out in the guideline. The judge then went on to explain that in the circumstances that he thought an appropriate course to take was to pass the same sentence with regard to each offender and in the circumstances imposed the sentences which we have mentioned.
24.
On behalf of the Solicitor General Mr Lloyd, who did not himself appear in the proceedings below, submits that these sentences were unduly lenient. He submitted that this was clearly, as the judge found, a category 1 case, necessitating the starting point of 12 years' imprisonment. He then drew attention to what he said were the numerous aggravating factors, quite apart from the matters which had a part to play in terms of the categorisation. Here, he said, this had a degree of planning; weapons, in the form of two swords and a knife, had been taken to the scene; there was then the combined attack on the unarmed Mr Brown, who had first been lured outside; and then the parties had returned home and sought to conceal the weapons used. Furthermore, quite apart from the seriousness of the injuries at the time, there has been a long-term and ongoing impact upon Mr Brown. It is said that overall, given all the circumstances, the judge should have gone up towards the very top of the range before then coming back, by way of giving credit for the mitigation, in particular the provocation and such other mitigation as was available: in particular perhaps, with regard to James Lamb given his previous good character and so on.
25.
On behalf of the offenders counsel variously were prepared to accept that this sentence was generous, or disputed that these sentences were unduly lenient. It was not disputed before us that the judge was entitled to impose the same sentence on each offender,
although obviously different points could be made with regard to each of them.
26.
We need to make one initial point. At the
Goodyear
hearing, as the transcript shows, counsel then appearing for the prosecution adopted an essentially neutral position and, for example, made clear that he did not accept the level of provocation for which the offenders were arguing. However, counsel then appearing for the prosecution did not make any reference to the powers of the Attorney General to refer the sentence on the ground that it might be unduly lenient any sentence imposed consequent upon what had been indicated at a
Goodyear
hearing.
27.
In written submissions on behalf of at least two of the offenders it is suggested to us that that in effect precludes the challenge now, on the footing that the offenders were in some way misled, or, at all events, they had a legitimate expectation that the sentences imposed would not be referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General. Indeed
Mr Hedworth (counsel appearing for David Lamb) in his written submissions has gone so far as also to assert that David Lamb would not have pleaded guilty had he thought there was a risk of a Reference.
28.
To the extent that those objections were pursued, this Court simply will not entertain them. True it is that under the
Goodyear
procedures, as the case of
Goodyear
itself stresses, counsel for the prosecution should, in cases where the point is applicable, draw the judge's attention to remind him of the power of the Attorney General to refer. But the
Goodyear
case itself also specifically makes clear that it is the responsibility of defence counsel to advise their clients of the possibility of an Attorney General's Reference and also specifically to advise their clients that they should not plead guilty unless they accept guilt. Mr Hedworth in fact informed this court that he considered that he had complied with his professional obligations.
29.
Consequently the present objections of this kind simply will not pass muster in this Court.
30.
It has in fact on numerous occasions been made clear in this Court that a failure by counsel for the prosecution to remind the judge of the availability of the powers to refer does not vitiate any subsequent challenge to the sentence being unduly lenient - see for example
Attorney General Reference No 48 of 2006
(R v Farrow)
[2007] 1 Cr App R(S) 90
. Put another way, if it be the case that any of the offenders here had an expectation that there would be no Reference to this court then it was not a ""legitimate"" expectation.
31.
Having disposed of that matter, we then turn to the substance of this Reference. As we have said, this unquestionably was a category 1 case, with a starting point of 12 years it unquestionably then had to move up significantly because of all the many serious and aggravating factors in this particular case. We agree with the submission of Mr Lloyd that those matters take this case up towards the top of the range of 16 years indicated as available by the Sentencing Guideline. But then, of course, there was the mitigation which was available to these offenders and not least in the form of the very grave provocation they had endured by reason of Mr Brown's prior conduct. We do not think that it can be said that the provocation arose on the day in question, if taken on its own. Here, in effect, the two, that is to say Paul Lamb and James Lamb, had been summonsed by David Lamb in effect to ""sort out"" Mr Brown. But the true gravamen of the provocation is that this was a culmination of the background in which Mr Brown had been physically assertive and dominating and bullying and, perhaps worse, over a significant period of time.
32.
James Lamb also of course had the significant mitigation of lack of previous convictions and it was clear that he was very remorseful about what he had done and he also had the observations made in the psychologist's report. Paul Lamb, too, although he had previous convictions, had been out of trouble for a significant amount of time, although, as we have said, David Lamb unfortunately had a very poor record indeed.
33.
We have to say that we have some doubts as to whether the provocation was quite of the order as the judge appeared to have assessed it: although we must of course have regard to his evaluation of the position. Even so, and giving full weight to the mitigation that was available and, in particular, the provocation, we think that an ending figure, before credit for plea, of not less than 12 years should have been taken in this particular case. The fact of the matter is that these offenders took matters into their own hands. We can understand the disinclination of people in their position not to go to the police. But here, for example, James Lamb was caring for his uncle; he would have had access to Social Services and one would have thought that, if only by way of caring for his uncle, the opportunity would have been there to tell Social Services of the kind of bullying and so on that David Lamb had been suffering. But that did not happen; instead they chose to do what they did on this particular day, in effect taking the law into their own hands. The result was, as Mr Lloyd submitted, a case of extreme
violence.
34.
That being so, and with all respect to the judge, this sentence was not simply very lenient, it was, in our judgment, unduly lenient. Indeed, it is striking that the judge, for no real explained reason, ended up with a figure of below the bottom of the range for then giving credit for the plea. That simply does not properly reflect the gravity of this offending, even giving full weight to the degree of provocation involved.
35.
Given the inevitable length of the sentence, Covid conditions in prison, although of course very unfortunate for any offender who currently is in prison, can only have a limited impact. However, we will also, to the extent that we feel possible, have regard to the fact that the judge clearly did desire to show a degree of leniency. Of course, we entirely to put out of account is the impact of any release date so far as these offenders are concerned, depending on whether or not the sentence exceeds 7 years.
36.
Taking the view, as we do, that these sentences are unduly lenient, we consider that it is our duty to increase them. In our judgment, giving credit of 20% for plea, as the judge was prepared to do, we think that the least sentence that can properly be imposed upon each of these offenders (and we will not distinguish between the three of them any more than the judge did because of the variety of factors involved) is one of 9 years' imprisonment. Accordingly, those will be the sentences substituted on count 2, the other sentences will stand and the appeal of the Solicitor General is allowed to that effect.
37.

1.
JUDGE STEPHENS QC: On 12th March 2007 in the Crown Court at Worcester, the appellant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to produce cannabis (Count 1), conspiracy to supply cannabis (count 2), and conspiracy to possess criminal property (count 4), all those conspiracies being committed between 1st December 2004 and 16th June 2006. On 18th January 2008 he was sentenced to 4½ years' imprisonment on count 1, 3 years' imprisonment on count 2 concurrent, and 30 months' imprisonment on count 4, to run consecutive to the 4½ years; that made a total of 7 years. He was also ordered to return to prison to serve 400 days out of the remaining period of 885 days of an earlier sentence from which he had been released on licence. He appeals against sentence by leave of the single judge.
2.
The charges arose out of a major investigation by West Mercia Police. 18 Linthurst Road, a house in a country road in Bromsgrove, had been used for the large scale cultivation of cannabis. The appellant was treated as the de facto owner of the house and the controlling influence, and he used family members to carry out the conspiracy.
3.
The entire property had been adapted for the cultivation of cannabis. An estimated outlay of £5,000 had been spent on equipment including seed trays, electric lights, extractor fans, and many metres of ducting. Different rooms contained plants at different stages of development. There were 587 cannabis plants in total, and it was estimated that the set up would produce three or four crops a year. If sold in kilos, the annual yield would have been worth £80,000 to £110,000. If sold in different ways, it could have been valued in the region of half a million pounds, or indeed, if sold for individual reefer cigarettes it would have been worth up to £900,000.
4.
The appellant's fingerprints were found on various pieces of equipment used in the cultivation of cannabis at the property.
5.
So far as count 2 was concerned, the appellant and two brothers called Lilley were seen regularly visiting a co-conspirator's home in Redditch. The Lilleys ran Hydro Power, an industrial brick cleaning business, and they were the appellant's notional employer. He received a wage from them which provided an apparently legitimate source for some of his outgoings. The company had started as a legitimate enterprise but was undoubtedly used by the appellant in connection with his drug related activities.
6.
He attended meetings with a Mr Brissett and when Mr Brissett's home address in Gloucester was searched, 12 grams of cocaine cut with benzocaine and other items were recovered. There were scales, two cash counting machines, a flak jacket and a Samurai sword was positioned behind the front door. The premises, it was said, had been used as a major repository for cash. On one occasion in March 2006 the appellant had sent a taxi driver to that address to fetch a large sum of money, and thus was his connection with that place established.
7.
So far as count 4 was concerned, the appellant, it was said, lived an extravagant lifestyle. Over a 15-month period he drove 18 expensive motorcars worth a total of £300,000. The home he shared with his girlfriend and co-conspirator, Hannah Brewster, had been furnished, improved and filled with the trappings of wealth. There was an excess of expenditure over legitimate income in the region of a quarter of a million pounds.
8.
The appellant's father, Mr Martin Bell, made false representations to obtain a mortgage on a property. Monthly repayments were channelled through Martin Bell's account via Brewster's bank account to further distance the appellant from the property. Mr Bell was the notionally insured for a number of the expensive vehicles driven by the appellant, to distance him from them. For the same reason, Chelsea Bell appeared as the notional purchaser on various finance agreements.
9.
Another matter which was drawn to the judge's attention was that the appellant had written a letter, whilst in custody serving his previous sentence, expressing his intention to get back on top and not to be deterred from pursuing criminality.
10.
The appellant has substantial previous convictions, the last being in December 2001. For causing grievous bodily harm with intent and perverting the course of justice, he had been sentenced to 8½ years' imprisonment. It was in relation to this sentence that he was on licence when he committed the current offences.
11.
A Pre-Sentence Report assessed him as constituting a high risk of harm to the public. He minimised his criminal involvement in the current offences. The writer of the report indicated that the appellant financed much of his lifestyle through dishonest offending. His family were supportive, despite the fact that his father, brother and partner had been convicted of linked offences. Obviously no alternative to custody was offered.
12.
The learned judge, His Honour Judge Cavell, made these observations in passing sentence. He refers, of course, to the appellant's previous detention and to the letter that he had seen. He found that he was the controlling influence behind the setting up of the operation, and the fact that his lifestyle had benefited in consequence. He referred to the purchase of 18 expensive cars worth £300,000 over a 15-month period, large scale improvements of his home and the expenditure which he had undertaken. The only real mitigation was that he had pleaded guilty. The sentences for the conspiracies to produce and supply cannabis would be concurrent because they arose out of the same facts. The sentence for conspiracy to possess criminal property would be consecutive. He explained then why he had reduced the portion of the unexpired part of the previous sentence because of the totality of the sentence that he was passing.
13.
We have had the benefit of written submissions from counsel for the defendant and also, albeit at the last minute, for the prosecution. Counsel who now represents the appellant, Mr Rex Tedd QC, submits, first of all, the sentence on count 4 of 30 months' imprisonment is wrong in principle. He argues that the criminal property referred to in count 4 was derived from the cultivation and sale of the cannabis which is the subject matter of counts 1 and 2.
14.
In his grounds of appeal, counsel says that the basis upon which deterrent sentences for production and supply of cannabis on a commercial scale are justified is by reason of the profits made, particularly by the organisers. In essence, he says that the sentences on counts 1 and 2 fully reflect the profits made by the production and sale of cannabis and the concomitant necessity of deterrence. So, he submits, the consecutive sentence on count 4 effectively duplicates the sentences on counts 1 and 2.
15.
We have been referred to the important case of
R v Xiong Xu
[2008] 2 Cr.App.R(S) 50, where this court gave guidance as to the appropriate levels of sentencing in cases of large scale production of cannabis. This appellant was treated as an organiser. In the ladder of responsibility there considered, the suggested starting point for an organiser is 6 to 7 years, depending on the quantity of cannabis involved, before taking into account any plea of guilty or personal mitigation. Deterrence, said the Court of Appeal, is the proper factor to be taken into account because such operations are so remunerative. Counsel conceded that the scale of the appellant's violation was typical of that referred to in
Xiong Xu
, but the judge clearly took into account the profits of the operation upon a deterrent basis in setting the sentences on counts 1 and 2. Moreover, he submits, he gave no reason for making the sentence for count 4 consecutive.
16.
Mr Cooke, representing the Crown, puts forward this proposition: that where the gravamen of the money laundering charge is different and adds to the conspiracy counts related to the production and supply of drugs, there is nothing wrong in principle in having consecutive sentences. He accepts, of course, that the sentences on counts 1 and 2 are properly concurrent but, he submits, count 4 extends the criminality and justifies the judge in passing the consecutive sentence.
17.
Two matters he refers to in particular which constitute the different gravamen, as he puts it, are: first, the ostentatious use of the wealth that the appellant demonstrated in his use of funds and the attitude demonstrated in the letter he wrote which sought to glamourise the nature of the criminal activity that he was taking part in; and secondly, counsel says (and this we think is a more significant argument) there is the defendant's cynical use of other people. He used close members of his own family and involved them in his activities, and in particular in the use he made of them in benefitting from the money that he was making from his drug related activities. He used his father in this way, the Lilley brothers, who had a legitimate business to begin with, and also his own sister who was used for the purpose of obtaining finance agreements in relation to the cars which distanced the appellant from the contracts involved.
18.
We have concluded that such activity did entitle the judge to pass a consecutive sentence on count 4. Each case depends upon its own facts and there will be cases where a money laundering charge may well not add to the overall criminality disclosed in drug related offences, whether conspiracies or specific charges. However, on the facts of this particular case, we have concluded that the judge was entitled to pass a consecutive sentence on count 4. In our judgment, the length of the sentence is not manifestly excessive, or indeed wrong in principle, and in those circumstances the appeal fails and the original sentence will stand.","citation:

Judgment
LORD JUSTICE HOOPER :
1.
Having quashed the appellant’s conviction for manslaughter it became necessary to sentence the appellant for the offence of robbery to which he had pleaded guilty at the PCMH and in respect of which the judge imposed no separate penalty. At the conclusion of the hearing we announced that we would impose a sentence of 10 years detention under
s.228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003
made up of a custodial term of seven years and an extension period of three years. We also ordered that the 265 days spent on remand is to count towards the sentence.
2.
We now give our reasons for that decision. The facts are very fully set up in our decision to quash the decision for manslaughter
[2007] EWCA Crim 1846
. We start with the judge’s sentencing remarks. He said:-
Rafferty, you are, of course, in a very different position. You were convicted of manslaughter on what was referred to at trial, as the causation basis. That is the violence which you bear responsibility, made a significant contribution to the death of Ben Bellamy at the hands of Taylor and Thomas, when they drowned him. Either by rendering him unconscious, so he could not resist drowning or if he remained conscious, by reducing his ability to resist drowning at their hands. On the evidence, that I have heard, I am satisfied, so as to be sure, that you bear responsibility, not only for an element of the violence used before you went to the cash point, but also for a degree of violence used thereafter.
I accept of course, that at one stage you said to the other two, ‘leave it there boys.’ But I am satisfied that you elbowed Ben Bellamy in the back, to keep him on the ground when attempts were being made by somebody else to stop the attack, by Thomas and Taylor. That evidence is your support for the attack that was being carried out. I am also satisfied that you anticipated that you would return to the scene of the robbery to meet up with Thomas and Taylor and that Ben Bellamy would have been kept there against his will, by the other two. That it seems to be followed inevitably from you three robbers agreeing to meet up, a considerable time later, at the spot where the robbery occurred.
I accept, of course, in accordance with the jury’s verdict, that not only did you not intend to kill Ben Bellamy but also you did not intend that he received really serious harm. I have read the pre-sentence report, dated 17 May 2006, you were born on 6 November 1987, you are now 18 years of age and seven months. You pleaded guilty to the robbery I am told when you were 17, but you were convicted of manslaughter, when you were 18. You are one of three people who attacked a defenceless person, alone at night. Then you left the scene, intending to return, you were aware of the conduct of Thomas and Taylor.
I bear in mind your guilty plea to the robbery, the fact that you, alone, of the defendants answered questions to the police and you gave an account which was, in essence, demonstrably accurate. I bear in mind your background, and your family support. In sentencing you, I have to consider the question of dangerousness, that is whether there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm, occasioned by the commission, by you, of furthe4r specified offences. The presumption of dangerousness, set out in s.229 of
the 2003 Act
, does not apply in your case, despite your previous conviction for affray. Because you were under 18 at the time that affray occurred. However, I am bound to consider all the relevant information about you in considering the question of dangerousness. In so doing, I consider your previous conviction, I considered these two offences. Also the knife incident in April 2004 and the content of the pre-sentence report.
Having done so, I conclude that the risk identified in chapter five of
the 2003 Act
, does exist in your case. This however, is not a case which calls for a life sentence, as far as you are concerned. I intend to pass upon you a sentence of imprisonment for public protection, that is an indeterminate sentence. You will be released only when the authorities consider that you are no longer a danger. Again I am required to fix a minimum term which you just serve before you can be considered for release. When you have served that term, you will not be automatically released, you will be released on licence, only when it is safe to release and that licence is liable to remain for the rest of your life. I impose this sentence only on the offence of manslaughter, having considered, in so doing, the associated offence of robbery. The term that I would have passed upon you, had I not been passing this sentence of imprisonment for public protection is one of ten years custody. I am required by statute, to halve that, and to deduct from it, the time that you have spent in custody, which I do. Given paragraph 30 of our judgment allowing the appeal against conviction it seems to us only right not to take into account when sentencing him, any responsibility for the violence used thereafter. Mr Elias submitted that we should also not take into account the reference by the judge to the appellant returning to meet up with the co-defendants and the appellant anticipating that Ben Bellamy would have been kept there against his will. It seems to us as Mr Spencer submits, that we are entitled to take that into account because it is part and parcel of the robbery.
3.
The judge refers to the previous conviction for affray. That is an important factor in this case and we have been provided with the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge Elystan-Morgan dated 11 November 2004. The appellant Rafferty pleaded guilty to an offence of affray at the close of the prosecution case and Joel Taylor the co-defendant in the case with which we are concerned pleaded guilty to an offence of wounding contrary to s.20 of the Offences against the Person Act. There had been an altercation in which a man had been assaulted. That led to “an atmosphere of threat and of a desire for violence” and to the co-defendant Taylor going to the home of a neighbour asking for a knife. The neighbour refused but Taylor armed himself with a sharp instrument. We were told that it was likely to have been a sharpened piece of bone. With that sharpened instrument Taylor stabbed McNeil deliberately twice in the lower back. Fortunately the wounds were somewhat superficial. In the words of the judge when he sentenced Taylor in Rafferty’s presence, he said to Taylor:
“But when you stabbed that man you knew not where that weapon was going; it could have gone into a vital organ and indeed the very gravest consequences could so easily have flowed from your act.”
The sentence passed was a detention and training order for a period of eight months. Insofar as Rafferty was concerned he said:-
“I take the view… that you were a peace maker and you did speak kindly and decently to McNeil and tried to explain to him what the situation was and tried to calm the others down. But at a late point in events you became a belligerent, in other words, you became a fighter rather than a peace maker, and I take that into account.”
Taking into account that Rafferty was a peace maker for a substantial period of time he passed a supervision order for the offence of affray.
4.
The importance of that conviction and those sentencing remarks is two-fold. We shall consider below the impact upon the assessment which we have to make by virtue of the provisions of Chapter IV of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003
. The involvement in this offence constitutes a substantial aggravating factor for the offence of robbery. Rafferty was again involved with Joel Taylor. He participated in the offence with Joel Taylor knowing Joel Taylor’s capacity to be as violent as he had been on the earlier occasion. To help Taylor in his assault on Ben Bellamy knowing of what Taylor was capable, is, in our view, a very serious aggravating factor.
5.
We now turn to the Guideline on sentencing for robbery. Rafferty was aged 17 at the time of conviction and the appropriate guideline is to be found at page 14. Mr Elias accepts that the robbery falls into either category 2 or category 3 although he asks us to find that it falls into category 2. He said that the conviction of manslaughter showed only an intent to cause some harm and that was sufficient to put it into category 2. In our view this is a category 3 robbery- serious physical injury was caused during the course of the robbery albeit that the defendant may have only intended some less serious harm. This being a category 3 robbery the starting point is seven years with a sentencing range of six to 10 years. The following aggravating features are to be found:-
More than one offender was involved.
The victim was restrained and detained during the course of the robbery.
The offence was pre-planned and committed at night.
There was an element of vulnerability insofar as the victim was concerned.
6.
In so far as the pre-planning is concerned, it seems clear that the idea of robbing Bellamy had been formed earlier before the arrival on the beach. Additionally the offence of robbery continued over a considerable period of time.
7.
In so far as the listed mitigating factors are concerned, there was evidence of remorse in the appellant’s admissions to the police that he had been involved in the robbery. However, even in his basis of plea to the robbery Rafferty did not disclose his true involvement in the robbery as found by the jury.
8.
We take the view that given all the aggravating features and in particular the fact that he committed this offence with Taylor, the sentence following a trial would be in the region of 10 years’ detention. Allowing for the plea of guilty we reduce that to seven years.
9.
We now turn to the issue of dangerousness. We must now reassess the judge’s conclusion. Having done so we have reached the same conclusion as the judge. In our view there is a significant risk to the members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by Rafferty of further specified offences. We have looked at the pre-sentence report. It shows a young man who is seriously disturbed and subject to substance and alcohol abuse. In the words of the probation officer there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant will react any differently should he be faced with a “same scenario” situation. To put it the other way, there is a significant risk that he will behave in that way. It seems to us that the circumstances of the robbery against the background of the affray in themselves provide sufficient evidence that the appellant is a significant risk within the meaning of s.225.
10.
Because Rafferty was only 17 at the time of the conviction we have to decide whether an extended sentence is sufficient or whether it is necessary to pass a sentence of imprisonment for public protection. We take the view applying s. 226 that an extended sentence will be adequate for the purpose of protecting the public from serious harm and it is not necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.
11.
These are our reasons for passing the sentence which we announced at the end of the hearing,","citation:

JUDGMENT
MRS JUSTICE STACEY:
1
This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against a sentence following refusal by the single judge, together with an extension of time of approximately six days in which to renew his application for leave to appeal.
2
On 12 June 2023, before the Common Sergeant of London sitting at the Central Criminal Court, the applicant, then aged 31, was sentenced to an extended determinate sentence of nine years and two months, comprised of a custodial term of seven years and two months and an extended licence period of two years, for the offence of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, contrary to
section 16
A of the
Firearms Act 1968
.
3
The single ground of appeal is that the judge erred in finding the applicant to be dangerous within the meaning of
section 279
of the
Sentencing Act 2020
and, therefore, erred in imposing an extended term of sentence with the consequence that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
The Facts

The applicant wanted to assist his mother to get a tenant, Tom Kennedy, out of a property that she owned.  Initially, he thought a brick through the window would be sufficient but a drug-dealing associate Kyle Kelson recommended that discharging a sawn-off shotgun would be more effective.  Mr Kelson obtained one for him and the applicant collected the weapon from Mr Kelson.
5
At around midnight on 18 June 2020, the applicant, his cousin Lee Matthews and another drug-dealing associate, Aaron McGrath, went to the applicant's mother's property where Mr Kennedy lived in Sutton.  They travelled
with the shotgun in Mr McGrath's car and a taxi ordered in the name of another.  The applicant pointed out
to the others the property where Mr Kennedy lived and his bedroom window which was at the front of the house.  The light was on and they presumed Mr Kennedy to be still up and in his room at the time.  The applicant then hid, waiting in the car in a nearby street, while Mr McGrath and Lee Matthews discharged the firearm through the bedroom window at the applicant's instigation and direction.  The applicant had played a leading role in a group activity intended to cause maximum fear and distress, and an actual firearm had been discharged.  Mr Kennedy was still up, and at home in his bedroom and in the event, by pure chance, he was uninjured. But what was done was extremely dangerous and could have had devastating consequences.
6
All three men left the area in a combination of three vehicles and went back to Mr Kelson's house, both to return the gun and to collect a consignment of cocaine that they had previously ordered and paid for.  It transpired that the drugs were not there and following an altercation between the applicant and Mr Kelson in the street, the gun went off in
Mr Kelson's face and he died at the scene.  The three men disposed of the shotgun immediately afterwards and it has never been found.  The applicant has been a professional Class A drug dealer for a number of years, earning several thousands of pounds a week.
7
The applicant, Lee Matthews, Mr McGrath and a fourth defendant named Gary Hayde were tried for the murder of Mr Kelson, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and for this offence.  On the first day of trial, the applicant, Lee Matthews and Mr McGrath pleaded guilty to this offence.  Lee Matthews, Mr McGrath and Mr Hayde were all acquitted of murder but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the applicant.  Following a retrial, the applicant was acquitted of murder and the offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life was left to lie on the file.  The Common Sergeant presided over both trials.
Sentence
8
The applicant had 10 convictions for 21 offences, spanning from 7 September 2010 to 9 November 2018.  His relevant convictions included possession of an offensive weapon in a public place (2011), common assault on three occasions (2013), assaulting a constable (2015) and a section 20 wounding (2018).  He was on licence at the time of this offence.
9
The victim personal statement made harrowing reading.  Mr Kennedy was completely upended and he lives in constant fear, and now sleeps in his car so he can keep on the move.  He has suicidal thoughts.  However, the judge accepted that this was Category 2 harm and not severe psychological damage as he felt he had to ignore the impact of Mr Kelson's death on Mr Kennedy since the applicant and the other defendants were found not guilty of
Mr Kelson's murder.  It was common ground that it was a high culpability offence with a starting point of six years and a range of four to eight years in accordance with the guidelines.
10
The judge found that there were four aggravating features of the crime.  First, a prohibited weapon - a sawn-off shotgun - had been used; secondly, the offence was committed as part of a group; thirdly, the firearm was disposed of following the incident and has never been recovered; and, fourthly, at the time of the offence the applicant was on licence for other offences.
11
In the context of the factual background, the judge regarded it as a very serious offence of its type.  The judge reminded himself of the sentences he had given to Lee Matthews and
Mr McGrath at the end of the first trial.  He had made an upward adjustment to the starting point for Lee Matthews to eight years, the top of the range.  But by an unfortunate mathematical error in applying a 10 per cent discount for the late guilty plea, he arrived at a final determinate sentence of six years and nine months, instead of the seven years and two months he had intended.  Once pronounced, it could not be increased and Lee Matthews retains the benefit of the judge's mistake.  Mr McGrath was sentenced to seven years.
12
The judge considered the applicant to be significantly more culpable than either Lee Matthews or Mr McGrath for three reasons.  First, unlike them, he was on licence at the time of the offence following his release from a three-year sentence for dealing in Class A drugs and a specified section 20 offence of violence (of wounding his girlfriend).  He had around nine months of his licence period still to run.  Secondly, he was the protagonist, organiser and principal mover.  Thirdly, he used the others to do his dirty work and he exposed them to greater risk of being caught.  The judge was particularly unimpressed with the way the applicant had hidden in Mr McGrath's car while the others fired the shotgun and how he had made sure the cars used were not his and taxis were booked in others’ names. He also considered there had been much planning by the applicant.  The judge found the applicant to be very selfish and a manipulative individual.
13
The judge concluded that a sentence outside the range was necessary and justified as the applicant was significantly more culpable than the other two.  He agreed to allow a 10 per cent discount for the guilty plea since it had been indicated to the prosecution a few weeks before the first trial even though the plea was not entered until the first day of the trial.
14
A pre-sentence report assessed the applicant as posing a high risk of serious harm to the public.  The nature of the risk was physical assault and associated emotional and psychological harm caused by controlling behaviour.  The pre-sentence report author also noted a long history of domestic violence.  The applicant expressed remorse and empathy in the pre-sentence report interview, but the report author was uncertain if the emotions and views expressed were genuine.
15
The judge was meticulous in disregarding the matters for which the applicant and his co-defendants were acquitted.
16
The judge concluded that there was a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission - - by the applicant of committing further specified offences in the future [for] four reasons.  He concluded that the applicant was a manipulative, self-centred and determined career criminal. Secondly, because unlike his co-defendants, he had been the principal player and it was he who had decided to initiate and commit the offence whilst on licence. Thirdly, because of the background of his involvement in a substantial Class A drug dealing over a number of years; and, fourthly, because of the views of the pre-sentence report author.
17
The judge concluded that an upward adjustment to the starting point be made to nine years from which he then deducted 20 per cent, arriving at a custodial term of seven years and two months, and imposed an extended licence period of just two years.
18
The single ground of appeal would be that the judge arrived at a sentence which was manifestly excessive as the judge incorrectly concluded the applicant was dangerous.
19
The limited differences between the applicant and his co-defendants did not justify an extended sentence for the applicant when the two co-defendants had received determinate sentences and no pre-sentence reports had been ordered for them.  It was submitted that the applicant's antecedent history was not particularly violent and was of a different type, unplanned domestic violence. No mention had been made of the extraordinary circumstances of the case which was that the offence had been committed as part of the applicant's tearful reunion with his mother and his desire to please her.  The pre-sentence report author had noted that lack of maturity may have had an influence on his actions.
Analysis and Conclusions
20
The trial judge was best placed to make an assessment of the facts and the risk the applicant poses in the future, having heard all the evidence in both trials which included the applicant giving evidence twice over the course of 10 days.  The learned judge made a careful and detailed assessment of the relevant factors in his sentencing remarks.  As already noted, he was meticulous in putting from his mind and directing himself to take no account of those matters for which the applicant had been acquitted.  He explained why he regarded the applicant as being in a different position from the two co-defendants.  His conclusion was based on four distinct actions, all of which were based on the evidence, including the conclusion reached in the pre-sentence report.  The conclusions in the pre-sentence report were consistent and supportive of the judge's conclusions.  The author was also quite correct in noting that it was the judge's decision ultimately.
21
The fact that the applicant's previous violent offending was not of the same level could not preclude a finding of dangerousness given the particularly serious nature of this offence.  The reasoning of the judge in his sentencing remarks is properly reflected in the material before the court (see
R v
Bourke
[2017] EWCA Crim 2150
).  There are no arguable grounds to interfere with the judge's assessment of dangerousness.  Mr Scobie KC correctly notes the imposition of an extended sentence is not automatic on a finding of dangerousness (see
Bourke
) but on the facts of this case, such a sentence was amply justified.  It is not reasonably arguable that the decision to impose an extended sentence was manifestly excessive.
22
Leave and leave for representation is refused and the extension of time is also refused.  It would not be in the interests of justice to extend time given the lack of merit in the appeal.

LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE:
I shall ask Mr Justice Goose to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE GOOSE:
1. This is an appeal against sentence brought with the leave of the single judge.
2. On 16
th
April 2018 in the Crown Court at Sheffield, His Honour Judge Kelson QC imposed nine years' imprisonment after the appellant, Nadeem Hussain who is aged 33, was convicted after trial. The sentence was made up as follows: for possession of a prohibited firearm, contrary to
section 5(1)
(aba) of the
Firearms Act 1968
(count 1), nine years' imprisonment; for possession of ammunition without a firearm certificate, contrary to
section 1(1)
(b) of the
Firearms Act 1968
(count 2), three years' imprisonment; having an imitation firearm in a public place, contrary to
section 19
of the
Firearms Act 1968
(count 3), nine months' imprisonment; and having an imitation firearm in a public place, contrary to
section 19
of the
Firearms Act 1968
(count 4), nine months' imprisonment. All of the sentences were ordered to run concurrently with each other. Orders for forfeiture and disposal of the firearms and ammunition were made.
3. The appellant was arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence, following which a search was undertaken at his home address at Kashmir Gardens, Sheffield on 30
th
September 2015. Inside the bedroom of the property, car keys were found which belonged to the appellant for use in a red Volkswagen vehicle which was parked nearby. In the boot of that car, police found a black holdall containing a prohibited firearm, a .38 calibre Arminius revolver with a barrel length of less than 60cm, which was a prohibited weapon. It had previously been deactivated and attempts had been made to reactivate the gun to restore it to working order. The evidence at trial established that the firearm could easily have been reactivated. This firearm comprised count 1 on the indictment.
4. Also found within the vehicle was a quantity of ammunition, including eight Browning 7.65 calibre rounds. A further quantity of other live ammunition was also recovered, including a blue shotgun 12 gauge cartridge, six hollow tip rounds measuring .38 millimetres, two shotgun 12 gauge cartridges, and a hollow top round and three Superfast fibre 7½ shotgun cartridges. An unspent Browning bullet was recovered from the footwell of the vehicle. In addition, some blank-firing ammunition was found. The appellant's fingerprints were found on a partial piece of a carrier bag that contained the shotgun cartridges.
5. Counts 3 and 4 related to two imitation firearms: a decommissioned UZ 9mm submachine gun with the outward appearance of a firearm (count 3); and a BBM silver/black metal self-loading pistol (count 4).
6. The appellant denied that the firearms or ammunition belonged to him and sought to blame others for having placed them in the vehicle which, he said, they had accessed with another set of car keys. The appellant's mobile telephones were seized. When they were analysed, they were found to contain various messages and images which referred to firearms. These included photographs that were dated 3
rd
October 2014, a WhatsApp conversation dated 14
th
August 2015, and messages relating to the appellant's desire to obtain an AK47 rifle with images of such a weapon. It was this evidence that led the judge to reach the conclusion that the appellant was not a mere custodian but was involved in the sourcing and obtaining of these firearms. Mr Howard, who appears on behalf of the appellant, criticises that finding.
7. The appellant has no relevant previous convictions. He was cautioned for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2002 and more recently, fined for a driving offence in 2012. Effectively, therefore, the appellant is a man of good character.
8. In sentencing the appellant, the judge took into account his relatively good character, together with letters of reference from those who described the appellant in favourable terms.
9. On behalf of the appellant it is submitted that the sentence of nine years' imprisonment was manifestly excessive. It is accepted that the judge was entitled to impose a global sentence in respect of all offending when imposing the sentence on count 1. Further, it is accepted that the sentence upon count 1 required the imposition of a minimum term of five years' imprisonment on the facts of this case. No argument is raised against the sentences upon counts 2, 3 and 4 of themselves.
10. In passing sentence, His Honour Judge Kelson QC referred to and took into account the case of
R v Avis
[1998] 1 Cr App R 420
. The judge took account of the sort of weapons involved – in particular, the prohibited firearm with its relative ease to be reactivated, and within which was live ammunition that was compatible with the weapon. Further, there was no lawful purpose for possession of the firearm. There was no clear evidence as to what use was being made of the firearm in count 1, nor those in counts 3 and 4. There is no evidence of the intention of the appellant in possessing the firearms, although he had plainly displayed a clear interest from the evidence obtained in his mobile phones.
11. Having considered the relevant factors identified for determination in
Avis
and the factors in mitigation, the judge, who had tried the appellant, correctly imposed a sentence of nine years' imprisonment, to take into account the totality of offending. The remaining sentences were ordered, in our judgment correctly, to run concurrently. We consider that whilst such a sentence might be said to be at the upper end of the range, it cannot be described as manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. The possession of such weapons, particularly those that are easily adaptable to be active is a very serious offence. We are also satisfied that the judge was correct to conclude that the appellant was not just a mere custodian. The possession of ammunition which was capable of being fired by the prohibited firearm is a seriously aggravating factor to be taken into account when fixing the overall sentence.
12. We are not persuaded that the sentence of nine years imprisonment for these offences was either manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal.

LORD JUSTICE GROSS:
I shall ask Mr Justice Martin Spencer to give the judgment of the court.
MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER:
1.
This is a case to which the provisions of the
Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992
apply. No matter relating to the victims of these offences shall during their lifetime be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify those persons as victims of these offences. This prohibition shall apply unless waived or lifted in accordance with
section 3
of
the 1992 Act
.
2.
On 7
th
September 2017, in the Crown Court at Swindon, the appellant was sentenced to a determinate sentence of seven years' imprisonment, followed by a consecutive extended sentence of thirteen and a half years, comprising a custodial element of eleven and a half years and a period of extended licence of two years. In addition, a Sexual Harm Prevention Order was made under
section 103 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003
until further order, and a restraining order was made under
section 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997
until further order.
3.
The appellant appeals against sentence by limited leave of the single judge.
4.
The facts of this matter were as follows. On 17
th
October 2016, TH, who was then 18 years of age, contacted the police and stated that she had been in a sexual relationship with the appellant which had started when she was 15 years old. The appellant would have known her age because TH was a friend of the appellant's sister. The sexual activity involved the penetration of TH's mouth and vagina by the appellant with his penis. That constituted counts 2 and 3 of the indictment (Sexual activity with a child, contrary to
section 9(1)
and (2) of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003)
.
5.
TH had tried to bring the relationship to an end, but the appellant refused to allow that. He stated that the relationship would not stop, that he would not let her go and that she was his. The appellant threatened to smash her mother's car and smash her windows if TH told anyone about the relationship. The appellant turned up at the family home on occasions at 4am and made so much noise that TH felt compelled to go with the appellant in order to stop him disturbing her family. The appellant tried to prevent TH from communicating with others. He smashed her phone on two occasions. He spat and projected snot at her and on one occasion urinated on her. The appellant assaulted TH, causing her to wet herself on one occasion. There was also considerable telephone data evidence which further demonstrated his coercive and controlling behaviour toward TH. As part of that controlling and coercive behaviour, the appellant had threatened to damage the property of TH and members of her family. This constituted count 1 on the indictment (Controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship, contrary to section 76(1) and (11) of the
Serious Crime Act 2015)
.
6.
The appellant was arrested and in October 2016 he was remanded in custody. While he was in custody, he arranged for numerous messages to be sent to TH asking how much money it would take for TH not to go to court and to withdraw her evidence. That was count 9 of the indictment (conspiracy to do acts tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice, contrary to common law).
7.
On 25
th
October 2016, the police interviewed a further complainant, DS. She informed the police that she had begun a sexual relationship with the appellant when she had been 15 years of age. She did not tell the appellant her age and the appellant never asked. She informed the police that the appellant had made threats towards their unborn child, she having fallen pregnant by him, and had threatened to damage DS's mother's car. The appellant was arrested and bailed.
8.
On the same day that the appellant was bailed, someone threw a rock through the window of the house of DS's mother and smashed the windows of the mother's car.
9.
There was a great deal of telephone evidence of the appellant's controlling behaviour towards DS and of his harassing conduct towards her.
10.
A police investigation failed to discover the identity of the offender who caused the damage to the property of DS's mother, but the pattern had been such that a proper inference could be drawn that the damage was caused by or at the instigation of the appellant. This was count 7 of the indictment (Putting a person in fear of violence, contrary to
section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997)
.
11.
CP was a prospective witness in the ongoing investigations in relation to the appellant. On 12
th
November 2016 a brick was thrown through the window of a house, narrowly missing a baby who had been asleep in a crib at the time. That house had been mistaken for the home of CP's mother who resided in the same street. Similar damage was caused to CP's maternal grandmother's home. Mobile phone and cell-site evidence, including locations where the appellant was held on remand, was obtained by the police. Both the appellant and his sister were charged with the offence of conspiracy to commit criminal damage, contrary to common law (count 8).
12.
A further complainant, SN, was interviewed by the police on 14
th
February 2017. SN told the police that she had met the appellant through Facebook when she had been 13 years of age and had had vaginal sexual intercourse with him. That was count 10 of the indictment (Sexual activity with a child, contrary to
section 9(1)
and
9(2)
of the
Sexual Offences Act 2003)
. The appellant would have known SN's age because it had been made clear on her Facebook profile. When SN had tried to end the relationship, she too had been subjected to constant harassment and intimidation by the appellant.
13.
In a Victim Personal Statement, TH indicated the effects of the appellant's controlling behaviour on her. They were psychologically extreme. At one point, she came very close to taking her own life. As the learned judge said, what should have been some of the happiest years of her life became a complete misery. She felt that she had been subjected to humiliation and degradation, which was what the appellant had wanted to achieve. She said that, psychologically, she still bears the scars and will do so for many years. The judge found that the effect of the appellant's behaviour on her might never disappear completely, and its effects had affected more than just TH. The judge said that he also took into account the effect on her family.
14.
The relationship with DS mirrored that with TH in many ways. In his sentencing remarks the learned judge said this:
""You sought to cause her fear of violence as much as you could, and of course it is the fear of violence that you have created, rather than any particular violence in itself, that you have pleaded guilty to and for which you must be punished. But again, so far as she is concerned, your behaviour was sustained and persistent, and I have read what she says about the effect upon her. In many ways, what she says mirrors what [TH] says. She was completely overborne by you. She is the mother of your child, and I bear very much in mind what I have heard about your reaction to her becoming pregnant and how you behaved during her pregnancy.""
15.
As we have said, SN was only 13 years of age when the appellant began a sexual relationship with her. The learned judge said:
""This is another relationship characterised by your violence, lack of respect, aggression, abuse and intimidation, and it seems to me that you show no sign at all of understanding the feelings of any of the three partners that you abused.""
16.
The learned sentencing judge found that the appellant was dangerous in relation to the specified offences under the
Sexual Offences Act 2003
. The sentence imposed was structured in such a way that for the offences in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3 on the indictment, the learned judge aggregated the terms of imprisonment so as to reach a sentence which he considered to be appropriate to reflect the seriousness of the overall offending for those offences. He then attributed the aggregate sentence to one of those counts, namely count 2.
17.
The sentences in relation to counts 1, 2 and 3 were individually, after a one-third discount to reflect credit for the pleas of guilty, two and a half years, four and a half years, and four and a half years respectively – a total of eleven and a half years' imprisonment, to which was added an extended licence period of two years, making the total of thirteen and a half years imposed in relation to count 2.
18.
That extended sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to a determinate term imposed for the other offences. The determinate term of seven years' imprisonment comprised two and a half years for the offence charged in count 7 and a consecutive term of four and a half years on count 10, together with concurrent sentences of three years' imprisonment on each of counts 8 and 9. Thus, the custodial sentence imposed was one of eighteen and a half years, with a two year extension.
19.
On behalf of the appellant, in a conspicuously clear and coherent Advice on Appeal which was supplemented today by equally clear and coherent oral submissions, Mr Smyth argues that there was no adequate basis upon which the judge could find that the appellant was dangerous and that the overall sentence was not just manifestly excessive, but, as he said, outside the parameters of normal sentencing for offending of the kind in question. He points out that if full credit for the guilty plea has in fact been given, then the sentences are equivalent to a total custodial term of almost 28 years' imprisonment after trial, which he argues goes to emphasise that, in reality, no proper credit for the guilty plea has been given and there has been no proper regard to the principle of totality.
20.
In addition, Mr Smyth argues that the Sexual Harm Prevention Order is in large part unnecessary, that it is disproportionate and, in some respects, insufficiently precise.
21.
For the respondent, Mr Barker, to whom we are grateful for attending at short notice and who represented the Crown in the court below, argues that the court should look at these offences in the context of seriously manipulative relationships. He points to the actions of the appellant in turning up, for example, at 4am, demanding sex with TH and taking steps to prevent disclosure, which has led to psychological harm. He submits that the judge was right to regard these as serious offences and was right to categorise the appellant as dangerous. He submits that concurrent sentences were not appropriate because of the perversion of the course of public justice and that the learned judge was right to mark the separate nature of those offences by the imposition of consecutive sentences and for that reason he structured the sentence in the way that he did, following the determinate sentence with the extended sentence.
22.
Mr Barker referred the judge to
R v Joyce and Pinnell
[2010] EWCA Crim 2848
, in which the Court of Appeal Criminal Division endorsed the procedure whereby the court can follow a determinate sentence with a consecutive extended sentence. It was in the light of that referral by Mr Barker that the judge structured the sentence in the way that he did.
23.
Despite the eloquence of Mr Smyth's submissions, we disagree with his arguments in relation to dangerousness. However, we do agree that the overall sentence was too long and manifestly excessive for these offences and, furthermore, that the Sexual Harm Prevention Order should be significantly curtailed.
24.
Starting with the finding of dangerousness, we agree with the learned judge's assessment where he said:
""It is quite clear to me that the public need to be protected from you. These offences, your antecedents and everything I have heard about you quite obviously establishes that there is a significant risk of your causing serious psychological harm to others either by sexual abuse or violence or both"".
25.
We regard as artificial the way in which Mr Smyth has sought to distinguish the offences in relation to the counts other than the specified counts and to draw that distinction for the purposes of section 229 of the Act. In our view, his submission is wrong in relation to the suggestion that the reference to such specified offences is by reference to those charged, as opposed to others. In our view, that judge was right to have regard to the risk of the appellant committing other specified offences in the future and he was entitled to use the specified offences as (in the words of Mr Smyth) a “tag"".
26.
From all that we have heard and read about the appellant, we regard his behaviour as such as fully to merit the finding of dangerousness which the judge made and therefore to justify an extended sentence. In our view, this is a man who preys on underage girls significantly younger than himself and then uses intimidation, sexual abuse and violence on them. The age disparity between him and the victims – for example, the age disparity of over ten years between SN, who was only 13, and the appellant, who is in his mid-twenties, is more than a sufficient disparity to justify the finding of dangerousness.
27.
However, we agree that the overall period of custody was too long and outside the usual parameters for this type of offending. We also agree that, although the structure of the sentence was generally appropriate, in making the sentences in relation to the harassment of SN consecutive to each other and to those in relation to TH, passing a determinate sentence, followed by the extended sentence, the sentencing judge failed to take sufficient account of the principle of totality in relation to the overall sentence passed.
28.
Although we could have adopted the same sentencing structure as the learned sentencing judge did, we consider that the simpler and more straightforward approach is to take one single extended sentence for one of the specified offences on an aggregated basis. Like the sentencing judge, we take count 2 for that purposes and make all the other sentences concurrent.
29.
The sentence on count 2 will remain at thirteen and a half years, of which the custodial element will be eleven and a half years and the period of extended licence two years. The other sentences will all remain the same, but will be concurrent with each other and concurrent with the sentence on count 2. This reduces the custodial element of the sentence from eighteen and a half years to eleven and a half years. In our view, this sentence adequately reflects the totality of the offending. In substituting this sentence, we wish to emphasise that, normally, an offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice would in principle merit a consecutive sentence, as was imposed by the learned judge. The course which we have taken in this case should not be regarded as derogating in any way from that principle.
30.
We turn to the Sexual Harm Prevention Order. The terms of the SHPO imposed were as follows:
“a) The defendant shall not allow any child under the age of 16 years to enter and / or remain at his place of dwelling being the address at which the defendant resides unless the parent or legal guardian of that child is aware of the defendants’ previous convictions and is present at all times
b)
The defendant shall not approach, engage in conversation or associate with, either by himself or through a third party, or by any means whatsoever, including by use of the internet, any female child under the age of 16 years, unless the parent or legal guardian of that child is aware of the defendant's previous convictions and is present at all times and the parent or legal guardian themselves has not been convicted of a sexual offence or an offence of violence.
c)
The defendant shall not undertake any activity or employment (either voluntary or paid) where a female child under the age of 16 years is also engaged in that activity or employment.
d)
The defendant shall not use any device capable of accessing the internet unless (i) it has the capacity to retain and display the history of internet use and (ii) he makes the device available for inspection on request by a police officer.
e)
The Defendant is prohibited from deleting the history of internet use from any device capable of accessing the internet.
f)
The defendant shall not enter any social network sites or chat rooms without the prior approval of the police or probation service.
g)
The defendant shall not create or use any email account unless he advises the police of all his accounts details, including his email addresses and passwords.
h)
The defendant shall not knowingly go to or remain at any address at which any person under the age of 16 years or vulnerable person resides or visits whilst that child is present at the address.
i)
The defendant shall not reside at any address that is situated within 500 metres of any secondary school with pupils between the ages of 11-16.
j)
The defendant shall not reside at any address that is situated within 500m of any establishment that has regular and organised activities attended by children between the ages of 11-16. These include, but are not limited to, youth organisations such as the scouts and military cadets. The suitability of any such establishment shall be decided by a police officer.”
31.
In relation to Sexual Harm Prevention Orders generally, we draw attention to the principles as set out in previous decisions of this court in
R v McLellan
[2017] EWCA Crim 1464

. Both are decisions over which my Lord, Gross LJ presided.

In
McLellan
the court made the following observations at paragraph 25:
""i) First, there is no requirement of principle that the duration of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order should not exceed the duration of the applicable notification requirements. … it all depends on the circumstances.
ii)
Secondly … a Sexual Harm Prevention Order may be made when the court is satisfied that it is necessary for the purpose of protecting the public or any particular members of the public from sexual harm from the defendant… As with any sentence, a Sexual Harm Prevention Order should not be made for longer than is necessary.
iii)
A Sexual Harm Prevention Order should not be made for an indefinite period (rather than a fixed period) unless the court is satisfied of the need to do so. An indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order should not be made without careful consideration or as a default option. Ordinarily, as a matter of good practice, a court should explain, however briefly, the justification for making an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order, though there are cases where that justification will be obvious.
iv)
All concerned should be alert to the fact that the effect of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order of longer duration than the statutory notification requirements has the effect of extending the operation of those notification requirements: an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order will result in indefinite notification requirements… Notification requirements have real, practical consequences for those subject to them; inadvertent extension is to be avoided.""
33.
In
Parsons
this court underlined the following at paragraph 5 of the judgment:
""i) First, as with Sexual Offences Prevention Orders, no order should be made by way of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order unless
necessary
to protect the public from sexual harm as set out in the statutory language. If an order is necessary, then the prohibitions imposed must be
effective
; if not, the statutory purpose will not be achieved.
ii)
Secondly and equally, any Sexual Harm Prevention Order prohibitions imposed must be
clear
and
realistic
. They must be readily capable of simple compliance and enforcement. It is to be remembered that breach of a prohibition constitutes a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment.
iii)
Thirdly, … none of the Sexual Harm Prevention Order terms must be oppressive and, overall, the terms must be proportionate.
iv)
Fourthly, any Sexual Harm Prevention Order must be tailored to the facts. There is no one size that fits all factual circumstances.""
34.
Bearing these points and principles in mind, we consider that there is force in some of the criticisms made by Mr Smyth of the Sexual Harm Prevention Order made in this case. Taking account of those criticisms, and accepting or rejecting them as appropriate, we substitute the Sexual Harm Prevention Order which has been circulated in advance of this judgment and which now reads as follows:
“(a) The appellant shall not allow any female under the age of 16 years who is not a relative to enter and/or remain at his place of dwelling being the address at which the appellant resides unless the parent or legal guardian of that child is aware of the appellant's previous convictions and is present at all times.
b)
The appellant shall not undertake any activity or employment (either voluntary or paid) where a female under the age of 16 years is also engaged in that activity or employment.
c)
The appellant shall not use any device capable of accessing the internet unless (i) it has the capacity to retain and display the history of internet use and (ii) he makes the device available for inspection on request by a police officer.
d)
The appellant is prohibited from deleting the history of internet use from any device capable of accessing the internet.
e)
The appellant shall not enter any chat room without the prior approval of the police or Probation Service.
f)
The appellant shall not create or use any email account unless he advises the police of all his accounts' details, including his email addresses and passwords.
g)
The appellant shall not knowingly go to or remain at any residential address at which any female under the age of 16 years resides or visits whilst that child is present at the address unless the parent or legal guardian of that child is aware of the appellant's previous convictions and is present at all times.”
34.
The Sexual Harm Prevention Order will be for a period of fifteen years. The custodial term which the appellant will serve will be between seven and eight years and therefore the Sexual Harm Prevention Order will be effective for between seven and eight years after his release from his sentence of imprisonment and we consider that to be proportionate, given the age at which he will be released.
35.
The restraining order shall remain in effect indefinitely, as imposed in the court below.
36.
This appeal is accordingly allowed as we have indicated.

1.
LORD JUSTICE LAWS: On 11th December 2003 before His Honour Judge McCreath at the Birmingham Crown Court, this appellant was convicted by the jury on seven counts of robbery and one of false imprisonment. He was sentenced to a total custodial term of 10 years. There had originally been eighteen counts on the indictment. The judge withdrew some seven counts from the jury and the appellant was acquitted by the jury on three further counts. The counts were renumbered upon the indictment being amended, but the judge referred to the original numbering in his summing-up and we shall do the same in this judgment.
2.
The seven counts of robbery on which the appellant was convicted were counts 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 17. Count 15 charged the offence of false imprisonment. The victim of the false imprisonment count was also the victim of the robbery charged in count 14. The appellant now appeals against his convictions with leave of the single judge.
3.
Apart from counts 10, 14 and 15, the essence of the offences was that they were knifepoint robberies at cash machines in the Birmingham area. The robbery charged at count 14 involved the imprisonment of the victim, hence count 15, in his own car.
4.
There is only one point in the appeal. It concerns the nature of the video identification procedure, evidence of which was placed before the jury in relation to counts 4, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. The procedure had been conducted relating to all these counts on 15th November 2002. The offences had variously been committed between August and November 2002 and the appellant had been arrested on 13th November 2002. The procedure is said to have been in violation of Code D promulgated by the Secretary of State under the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
, and to have been highly prejudicial to the appellant. We shall describe it shortly. These defects are said to render the convictions in question unsafe. It was initially contended also that the other convictions, that is to say counts 8 and 10, were contaminated by the faults relating to the others so that they too were unsafe. Before confronting the arguments we should give a thumbnail sketch of the facts.
5.
As the appellant's counsel Mr Hayes acknowledges in his advice, there was a common thread to the case, namely that the complainants broadly described their attacker (there were some variations in the descriptions) as a black man in his late thirties or forties with greying hair and a greying beard. It is clear also that at the time of his arrest in November 2002 the appellant was of somewhat unusual appearance. He had black hair, was grey around the temples and had a grey goatee beard. He is now a man of 49 years of age.
6.
The appellant's counsel's advice contains a very useful and succinct account of the facts of the cases in which the relevant identification procedure was used and we can do no better than replicate it with some adaptation.
7.
Count 4. At 7.40 pm on 5th August 2002, Mr Henry Sowden walked to the Lloyds TSB cashpoint on the Birchfield Road in Birmingham. A black man aged approximately 55 or over, he was to say, five foot nine tall and of lean build with white facial stubble on his cheeks, robbed him using the words ""move away or I'll cut you"".
8.
Count 12. At 8.55 am on the morning on 12th September 2002, Mr William Clutterbuck was robbed at the same cashpoint. He described the robber as a black man aged 30 to 35 years, five foot ten, slim build with a rough grey beard.
9.
Counts 14 and 15 we take together. On 28th October 2002 Mr Ali was driving home when he was stopped by a black man between 42 and 45 years old with a stubbly beard. He had a knife which he placed to Mr Ali's throat. Mr Ali was robbed, stabbed and unlawfully kept in his car.
10.
Count 16. On 8th November 2002 at 12.05 pm Mr Jhitta was robbed at the Birchfield Road cashpoint. He described the robber as about 50, medium build, full face beard which was short and contained flecks of grey. He said the man spoke with a West Indian accent.
11.
Lastly, count 17. On 12th November 2002 at 9.15 in the evening at the same cashpoint, Mr Terence Brown was robbed at knifepoint. He described his robber as a light-skinned black man, 35 to 45 years old with short grey hair, a beard and moustache. He said the moustache was fairly bushy and greying.
12.
The appellant gave evidence at trial in his own defence and denied any involvement with any of these robberies.
13.
There are some points to add to this bare summary. First as regards count 12, the robbery of Mr Clutterbuck, we should notice that there was another witness, Miss Lisa Breakwell, who for five to 10 minutes had watched two men loitering near a bus stop. She said that one was in his late thirties, had facial stubble and was wearing a cap. The men went towards the cashpoint where Mr Clutterbuck had gone. Miss Breakwell did not see any robbery but saw the two men leave the cashpoint area. We shall refer to her participation in the video identification in due course.
14.
Next in relation to count 16, the robbery of Mr Jhitta on 8th November 2002, there was also the evidence of a police officer, DC Vinall. He knew the appellant well from previous encounters. He looked at pictures taken on the occasion in question by the bank's CCTV camera and he confidently and readily identified the appellant as shown on them.
15.
Now we should mention counts 8 and 10, which are not affected, certainly not directly affected, by the impugned identification procedure. Here there was powerful evidence supporting the Crown case. The relevance of any discussion of these counts is only to the suggestion that any defect in the convictions on the other counts contaminate the convictions on these. Count 8. A cap bearing the appellant's DNA was admitted to belong to him and in the struggle which took place between the female victim of the crime and her attacker (this was another robbery at the Birchfield Road cashpoint) the assailant's hat had fallen off. There was plainly a continuity of evidence between the hat lost in the struggle and the hat bearing the appellant's DNA. On count 10, a street robbery in which the female victim was assaulted in the street and robbed of her jewellery, the victim identified the appellant at an entirely different video identification on 8th May 2003 of which no complaint is or could be made.
16.
Now we may turn to the procedure which is said to have rendered the convictions unsafe. On 14th November 2002, Inspector Hunt met with the appellant and his legal representative. It was agreed that a video identification procedure was appropriate, but it was not practically possible to assemble a sufficient number of volunteers of similar appearance to the appellant so as to hold a parade. If a video procedure was to be adopted, paragraph D:2 of Annex A to Code D required that the set of images to be used must include the suspect and at least eight other people who so far as possible resembled the suspect in age, height, general appearance and position in life. To try and find similar images Inspector Hunt searched two databases which contained some 19,000 pictures. They did not however include eight persons who sufficiently resembled the appellant in age and general appearance. Inspector Hunt selected what he thought were the best eight out of these collections. Because, as we understand it, these eight did not sufficiently resemble the appellant, Inspector Hunt arranged for the images, together with the image of the appellant that was to be used in the procedure, to be masked -- that is to say marks were superimposed on the area of the temples and lower face as to obscure any facial hair or grey hair in those areas. So much was done with the knowledge and consent of the appellant and his adviser. But Inspector Hunt undertook another initiative unknown to the appellant or his legal representative. He caused two parallel compilations to be created of the same images in the same order but this time with no masking. We may at this stage take up the narrative as it was given by the learned trial judge in the course of his ruling made on 2nd December 2003 to the effect that the video identification should be admitted: (Transcript 1, page 4 at A):
""The decision had been made that, in the event of a witness being unable to make an identification from the masked images, he or she would then be shown one of the unmasked compilations. Inspector Handley, the officer who conducted the procedure, informed Mr Marcus' representative of that intention. She objected, both then and at the end of the procedure, arguing that it was in breach of Code D and was tantamount to a confrontation. Inspector Handley overruled the objection.
The decision to proceed in this way had, it seems, been taken after discussion with the CPS, there having been some disquiet amongst operational police officers about the inadequacies of video procedures where the witnesses had found it impossible to make identifications from obscured images. The discussion had not arisen in the present case but was of a general nature. The police decided, having received that advice, to proceed in this way in this case and to leave it to the trial judge to determine whether the evidence should be admitted.""
We find it wholly extraordinary, quite aside from anything else, that it was decided not to inform the defence of this remarkable procedure until immediately before it was actually undertaken.
17.
The video identification procedure was implemented, as we have said, on 15th November 2002. The results are summarised in a table contained in the skeleton argument prepared by Mr Burrows from the Crown and we may adapt it for the purposes of this narrative as follows. First count 4 and Mr Sowden. At the masked procedure the defendant stood at position 7. Mr Sowden made no identification. At the unmasked procedure the defendant was also placed at position 7 and Mr Sowden said: ""I want to look more closely at number 7. I think so, number 7."" Count 12. In the masked procedure the defendant was at position 5. Mr Clutterbuck, asked if he could make an identification from the masked images, said: ""Yes number 2."" Miss Breakwell was asked about the masked procedure also. She asked to see number 5 again. She said: ""The blobs put you off but number 5."" Counts 14 and 15. In the masked procedure the defendant was in position 5. Mr Ali said: ""It is very difficult. Number 5 or number 8 are the closest. I can't be certain because of the absence of the beard."" In the unmasked procedure, the defendant was again at position 5. Mr Ali said: ""Can I see number 5 again. I think it's number 5."" Count 16. At the masked procedure the defendant was at position 7. Mr Jhitta could make no identification. At the unmasked procedure the defendant was again at position 7. Mr Jhitta said: ""I cannot say 100 per cent but it could be number 7."" Lastly count 17. The defendant was at position 7 in the masked procedure. Mr Brown said: ""Could I look at number 7 again. Number 7 is the closest. Until I see the features I cannot be 100 per cent."" At the unmasked procedure the defendant was again at number 7 and Mr Brown said: ""At the time of the incident he had more beard. Yes, number 7.""
18.
It is not without some importance, as we understand the facts, that all the volunteers or persons whose images had been selected were persons in their twenties and only two had any sort of facial hair. By contrast the appellant was in his forties with a greying beard.
19.
Inspector Hunt was cross-examined upon a voire dire before the learned trial judge, conducted in the context of the defence application to exclude the video identification evidence pursuant to section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. We do not have a transcript of this evidence but the summary given in the appellant's counsel's advice is, as we understand it, accepted as accurate. We may quote from that:
""In cross-examination Inspector Hunt admitted that Mr Marcus's features were unusual and could not find similar volunteers on the database. He admitted that the unmasked procedure came about by operational officers claiming that masking led to poor results and as a result the CPS had advised acting Detective Styles to implement a new procedure of showing an unmasked tape to volunteers where no identification had been made. He accepted that the new procedure was not envisaged by Code D and that because of the appearance of the other volunteers Mr Marcus would, 'blatantly stand out'. He also was of the view that this procedure was 'blatantly unfair' to Mr Marcus. He was also of the view that this was the first attempt at unmasking and that the force would be waiting to see whether the judge concluded if it was lawful. Finally, he accepted that Mr Marcus had been denied his opportunity to choose whether to pull out of the procedure altogether.""
As the judge said, it was common ground that the use of the unmasked images contravened Code D. Indeed that must be so. It was only necessary to resort to the device of the masked images for the very reason that otherwise there would not be images of at least eight other people resembling the suspect in age, height, general appearance and position in life. The unmasked images by definition failed to meet that criterion.
20.
In his ruling, by which he allowed in the identification evidence based on the unmasked images, the judge said this at 6E:
""The police were left with a choice between three options:
First to hold no identification procedure of any kind. To have taken that option was unthinkable and it is not argued that it should have been taken.
Secondly, to hold a video procedure, however flawed it might have been.
Thirdly, to move to a confrontation.
In reality, the choice lay between these two latter options. It does not take a moment's thought to see which of the two was preferable. Confrontation is a clumsy device, lacking in transparency and almost always likely to lead to a risk of unfairness to the accused.""
Then at 7D:
""Whatever its flaws, the procedure adopted in this case had the virtue of transparency. It was conducted in the presence of the defendant's representative and, above all, it was recorded so that there is available an unimpeachable record of the procedure. A jury would thus be able to see exactly what was done and to hear, with a little difficulty, I accept, but to hear, nonetheless, exactly what was said.""
Then at 9C:
""To the extent that the identification procedures in this case were imperfect, the trial process is fully equipped to expose those imperfections to the jury, not least because of the existence of the unimpeachable record to which I have referred.
Ultimately, the task of assessing the weight to be given to this evidence is preeminently one for the jury and I am confident that they can be entrusted to perform that task conscientiously and fairly.
In those circumstances and for the reasons which I have sought to give, I rule that this evidence ought to be admitted.
To rule otherwise would have an effect on the proceedings which section 78 is designed to avoid.
I perhaps should add this, that I have reached this decision on the particular facts of this case and, insofar as anybody has regarded this case as what is described to me as 'a test case', then they are wrong to do so. I understand this is the first time that a judge has had to rule on a matter of this kind and rule I have but I have ruled in respect of this case and in the particular circumstances and in the particular context of this case and I am not to be taken to, by giving this ruling, to have given some sort of blanket approval to this sort of procedure in all cases. The admissibility of the evidence of whatever kind in any case will depend on the peculiar and particular circumstances of that case and for it to be thought that I had ruled that this sort of parallel viewing, if I can so describe it, is always appropriate evidence, to think that would be to make a great error.""
21.
We should notice in passing that the judge gave an impeccable general direction on the dangers relating to identification evidence when he came to sum the case up to the jury -- see page 8E and following in the transcript of the summing-up.
22.
As we have just indicated, the learned judge disavowed any general implications arising from his decision to admit this identification evidence. He said he arrived at the decision on the particular facts of the case. But that with respect is very difficult to reconcile with his observations, no doubt entirely accurate, to be found at transcript volume 1 page 4C to D, that the police had decided to use the unmasked images following discussions with the CPS of a general nature as to the difficulties arising when masked images did not yield identifications.
23.
In our judgment, what has happened here is that a procedure, the use of masked images, did not yield sufficient identification evidence for effective use in court, and so the police, prompted it seems by the CPS, adopted a further and very different procedure: the use of unmasked images which was avowedly and necessarily in violation of Code D. A procedure, moreover, which the senior police officer who set it up himself accepted was blatantly unfair to the appellant. And it was imposed in the appellant's case with no sensible notice being given of it to him or his advisers.
24.
If this appeal is dismissed that position might be replicated in other cases. The court would have validated in principle, or might be taken to have done so, the use of a procedure which violated the Code. That in our judgment would be quite wrong. The course taken by the police here was a deliberate device to evade the provisions of the Code. That falls to be condemned by this court. In these circumstances, the judge should have excluded the evidence. It is not for us to say, but it may be possible (as my Lord Davis J suggested in the course of argument) that given modern technology video images might be edited so for example as to add the appearance of facial hair or the like, and that might be preferable to the somewhat crude procedure involving the masking that was done here. Plainly the consent of the defence would be required. But that obviously is for consideration elsewhere.
25.
There was some other evidence against the appellant on the relevant counts, but it is very doubtful whether he could reasonably have been convicted without the identification evidence and on most of these counts he plainly could not. The convictions are accordingly unsafe and the appeal will be allowed on the counts which depended on the evidence which we have criticised, that is to say counts 4, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. That said, we see no reason whatever to upset the convictions on counts 8 and 10. We do not accept that either of them was contaminated by the flawed procedure which we have condemned. There was powerful freestanding evidence to support the Crown case on each. Mr Hayes for the appellant effectively conceded as much, and rightly so.
26.
For all the reasons we have given, the appeal against conviction is allowed to the extent indicated.","citation:

Judgment
Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, CJ:
Introduction
1.
On 19 December 2013 the appellant was convicted of the murder of his wife Li Hua Cao on or about 23 October 2006 at the Central Criminal Court before HHJ Nicholas Cooke QC and a jury. On 7 January 2014 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 22 years less 209 days in respect of time spent on curfew. The appellant was ordered to pay £120,815.05 towards the costs of the prosecution.
2.
His application for leave to appeal was made on several grounds. The single judge refused leave on three grounds of appeal and referred two grounds of appeal for consideration by the Full Court. One ground alone was pursued in respect of conviction which relates to the conduct of Michael Wolkind QC. He appeared for the appellant with Michael Skelley, instructed by Michael Kaye. Mr Wolkind was dismissed on 16 December 2013 after he made his closing speech in the circumstances we set out at paragraph 43. It was the case for the appellant that Mr Wolkind’s conduct was incompetent to a degree that rendered the conviction unsafe in accordance with the principles set out by Buxton LJ in
R v Day
[2003] EWCA Crim 1060
.
3.
No criticism was made of junior counsel or of the solicitor. Each was called by the appellant to give evidence. Mr Wolkind provided a statement and was called by the court at the request of both parties and in accordance with the practice of the court he was cross-examined.
4.
Before turning to the specific matters relied on, it is necessary to set out a brief summary of the case against the appellant and his defence.
The background
5.
The appellant was a wealthy property developer and jeweller. His wife had come from China with her brother to Ireland to learn English in about 2003. The wife had stayed on, working as a waitress. The appellant’s evidence was that he met her in a “lap dancing” club in November 2005 in Dublin where she worked. They married in China in July 2006 and went through a second marriage ceremony in England on 4 October 2006. She was pregnant.
6.
They made their home at Flat 9, Pavilion Court, Mount Vernon Estate, Hampstead in North London. The appellant owned a number of other properties nearby. Following the wedding ceremony in England the wife was granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom until 5 October 2008.
The initial investigation
7.
The wife had opened a bank account in London on 20 October 2006. It was never used.
8.
In February 2007 Li Bin, the wife’s brother to whom she had last spoken on 23 October 2006, reported to the police that she was missing as none of the family had heard from her at the time of the Chinese New Year. Although the appellant had not contacted police, he cooperated with the police enquiry that followed in 2007. He was spoken to by the police in February, May and August 2007 and gave a significant witness interview in October 2007.
9.
He told them that his wife had left him in mid-November 2006 as she had done on previous occasions. She had not told him where she was going. He believed that she had returned to lap dancing in Dublin. The initial investigation concluded in December 2007 that the wife was “a free spirit … used to travelling … (and) had many short-term relationships.”
10.
A full murder investigation began in February 2012 when she had failed in the intervening years to contact her family. The appellant voluntarily attended a witness interview and answered all questions under caution in 2012. The appellant was charged with his wife’s murder on 7 June 2012 and then again interviewed.
11.
The body of the wife has never been found. There was no forensic evidence of any alleged place or cause of death. There was no forensic evidence at any of the appellant’s properties or in his vehicles. CCTV recordings on the Mount Vernon estate had only been kept for 14 days. No case was made by the prosecution precisely as to how or when she was killed.
The case for the prosecution
12.
The case for the prosecution was based on circumstantial evidence. Many witnesses were called, including the wife’s brother and two sisters, those who had known her in Ireland, members of the Chinese community in London, those who dealt with her in relation to her pregnancy and its possible termination, private investigators, those who worked on the Mount Vernon estate, those who had let Flat 9 Pavilion Court after 2006, those who conducted the missing person inquiries in 2007 and 2012. The prosecution had intended to call a resident of the Mount Vernon estate who had much more direct evidence, but a decision was made not to call her shortly before the trial
13.
In terms of seeking to prove the wife’s death the prosecution relied generally upon:
i)
The wife’s lack of contact with her family and friends after speaking to her brother on 23 October 2006. That was out of character. Her brother’s evidence was that they were very close and in contact by phone and text.
ii)
Her landline, mobile telephone, e-mail account and bank accounts had not been used after October 2006.
iii)
Her failure to attend appointments relating to her pregnancy.
iv)
The fact that all enquiries seeking to establish proof that she was still alive came to nothing.
v)
The failure of the appellant to make any enquires about her or the child which she was carrying.
vi)
Lies told by the appellant.
14.
The prosecution relied upon specific evidence relating to the period before her last telephone call to her brother on 23 October 2006.
i)
The appellant had a “nasty temper.” He was said to be controlling and disapproving about his wife’s past. She had told police in the past that she was afraid of him and that he had assaulted her in August 2006, though she subsequently retracted the allegation.
ii)
He was said to be a controlling man who restricted her access to money and to other people. Her brother’s evidence was that there had been a change after the wedding as he would not allow her to work and she felt she had no freedom and no friends. The evidence of her sister, Li Hong Cao, was to the same effect; she was afraid of him; she was unhappy and wanted to return to China.
iii)
They had a loud argument in China in July 2006, which resulted in bruising to her arm and scratches to his chest. The argument was overheard by the wife’s sister Li Hong Cao, and was said to be about her desire to leave possessions the appellant had bought her, at her family home in China. Her evidence was that the police had been called, but the case was dropped after it was agreed that monthly payments would be made to her parents.
iv)
The appellant was obsessed by her lap dancing past and whether she had continued lap dancing after she became his girlfriend. In late August 2006 he hired a private investigator and in October 2006 contacted polygraph companies.
v)
There was evidence of a previous report to police of the wife going missing. The appellant had called police on 15 August 2006 and referred to a text message which suggested she was considering suicide. When police made contact with the wife she told police that she was scared of the appellant. The appellant repeatedly called and texted; she did later agree to be picked up by him and taken home. In contrast in October 2006 he made no effort to telephone her and did not contact the police.
15.
The prosecution relied on the following evidence of matters that had occurred on 23 October 2006 as pointing to the killing having occurred then or thereabouts:
i)
At 20:00 on 23 October 2006, the wife had spoken to her brother. About 3 hours later, a telephone call was made from 9 Pavilion Court to the appellant’s mobile telephone. At 23:07, the appellant’s key fob was activated allowing access to the car park. At 23:44 and 23:58 the appellant telephoned his parents.
ii)
The appellant went out in the early hours of 24 October to a nightclub in London’s West End having telephoned the manager of the nightclub at 01:08 from 9 Pavilion Court. A parking ticket was issued to the appellant’s father’s car at 03:15, near to the nightclub.
iii)
The appellant accepted that he was the last person to see her.
iv)
The inherent implausibility of the appellant’s account of her leaving Flat 9 on the Mount Vernon Estate on a night in October 2006 with her packed bags and no one having heard from her after that time.
16.
The prosecution then relied on events after 23 October 2006 as confirming the appellant had killed her:
i)
After that night the appellant went to live with his parents and never used the flat again.
ii)
He sent text messages pretending to be his wife and asking for the contact details of her former roommate.
iii)
He sent a series of text messages to his previous girlfriend; the prosecution suggested he was trying to rekindle the relationship.
iv)
There had been “unusual key fob activity” showing repeated access from one of the car parks to Flat 9 on 8 November 2006 between 21:45 and 00:04.
v)
There was a sighting of the appellant being driven by his father from Flat 9 by one of the security porters in a “zombified” state possibly on the same date.
vi)
On 17 November 2006 a midwife telephoned and said that the wife had not attended for a scan. The appellant said that he was not sure why this was and that he would ask her to telephone later that evening.
vii)
A series of works were undertaken on Flat 9 prior to it being rented out on 21 December 2006. These included replacing the original carpets with new carpets of the same colour, the cleaning of the marble floors and a new partition between the bedroom and living area, from which the inference might have been drawn that he was anxious to remove incriminating traces.
viii)
The wife’s wedding ring, purchased as part of a matching set, and other possessions were recovered from a storage unit being rented by the appellant and his father in June 2012. The appellant had previously told police that his wife had taken all of her possessions with her when she left.
The defence case
17.
The defence case was that the wife was not necessarily dead and, if she were, the appellant was not responsible for her death. His case was that on 23
October 2006, she had told him that she was leaving him because her family needed her. She packed her bags and left the flat. He never saw her again. She was unhappy in her marriage and bored by his life-style in London. He gave evidence to that effect at the trial.
18.
In supporting that case, and responding to the prosecution case he relied on the following:
i)
The wife had quickly become unhappy in the marriage, bored in London and had not wanted the baby. She left him on 23 October 2006 for those reasons.
ii)
She had not been as close to her family as the prosecution evidence suggested. Her parents had divorced when she was young and she lived with an aunt for 7-8 years. She had never lived with her family for any sustained period.
iii)
She resented her brother who lived in Denmark because he did not send money home to her parents as she did.
iv)
In August 2006, she had been reported missing. She had telephoned in response to a call from the police, but said she did not want her whereabouts disclosed as she was frightened of her boyfriend. This information had been passed on to the appellant.
v)
On 15 August 2006 she had sent him a text message saying:
“I hope you can get good life with your money you are a bad boy in the world – I do not need money I am still can get good life after few year I will show you.”
vi)
She had withdrawn £1,800 from her Lloyds account on 10 October 2006. If she wanted to disappear and not be traced she would not use the known accounts after this as it would allow her to be traced.
vii)
She had spoken of terminating the pregnancy. She had attended an initial consultation with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, but did not attend on 19 September 2006 for a scheduled termination. At the time of her disappearance she was 19 weeks pregnant and was therefore approaching the time limit for a legal termination.
viii)
In August 2006 after she had left the appellant, she had told Yin Tuen, a prosecution witness who helped Chinese people find work, that she would be prepared to work as an escort to make money.
ix)
She had no links with the UK other than her marriage to the appellant and therefore it was likely she would have gone to China or Ireland.
19.
As to the prosecution’s circumstantial evidence against him relating to matters before 23 October 2006, the appellant’s case was that:
i)
Although he had a temper, he had not been violent towards her. He accepted that there had been an altercation in the street on 28 August 2006, but he did not assault her. She made a formal withdrawal of the statement she had given to police, stating: ‘My husband Robert … has never been violent towards me.’
ii)
He did not restrict her, beyond restricting (a) her cooking because his Jewish faith involved restriction on his diet, and (b) her working, because she was pregnant and he did not want her to work.
iii)
They argued in China because she wanted to give away gifts that were sentimental. She had scratched him and he had restrained her by the wrists.
iv)
He had only hired a private investigator to establish whether she was still lap dancing as she had said that she was not.
v)
They had argued over the pregnancy, as he had wanted her to have the baby.
20.
In respect of the evidence of events after 23 October 2006, the appellant maintained:
i)
He had telephoned his parents on 23 October as he was upset that she had left him.
ii)
There was no record of anything unusual in the security log at the Mount Vernon estate on the night of 23 October 2006.
iii)
He had decided to move out of Flat 9 prior to the disappearance as he and his wife were moving into a different flat in Heathview Court in any event, and he had already started to furnish the new home in September.
iv)
He wanted to let Flat 9 for a commercial rent. The carpets, cleaning and modifications were undertaken in furtherance of renting out the flat. The carpet changing was negotiated by his father and was a £1,500 investment which made sense since the flat could be rented for £3,000 per month, professional cleaning is standard and a partition was erected as that was a term of the lease with an incoming tenant. The evidence of a letting agent was to the effect that the new tenants wanted modifications.
v)
The attempts to contact Ireland and the wife’s friends in late October represented an indirect attempt to trace her by finding out the whereabouts of previous flat mates.
vi)
If he had been trying to lay a false trail by pretending to be her, he would not have used his own phone
vii)
He had contacted his ex-girlfriend in November 2006 as a “shoulder to cry on”.
viii)
The key fob activity of 8 November 2006 was him moving personal belongings out of the flat.
ix)
He admitted that he had not been frank with the midwife. This was due to embarrassment at being left by his pregnant wife and not knowing where she was.
x)
As for the wedding ring, it was found along with his own in the suitcase because neither of them regularly wore them and they were put in the suitcase in their presentation boxes after the UK marriage on 4 October 2006. The suitcases would have been placed in storage at some point in 2008. His suggestion in the 2012 interview that she had taken the ring with her, would have been an assumption, and the mistake therefore owed to a lapse of memory due to the passing of time rather than a lie.
xi)
He had not contacted police after his wife’s disappearance because she had been angry on previous occasions when he had involved the police. He believed not that she was missing but that she had left him as she had done before.
xii)
He had been depressed after his wife left and did not report her missing because to him she was not missing, but had left of her own free will.
xiii)
Although he had been identified as the last person to see his wife on 23 October 2006, no one else would necessarily remember something as mundane as a person leaving the estate where they lived on foot.
21.
The trial began on 31 October 2013. The prosecution called 36 witnesses between 6 November 2013 and Wednesday 27 November 2013 when the prosecution closed its case. A submission of no case to answer was made on Friday 29 November 2013. The judge ruled there was a case to answer on Monday 2 December 2013. Mr Wolkind made an opening speech on the morning of Wednesday 4 December 2013 and the appellant was then called. He gave evidence until 10 December 2013 when 2 defence witness were called. The prosecution closing speech took the whole of Wednesday 11 December 2013 and part of the morning of Thursday 12 December 2013. The defence speech began at 12.15 that day; it continued until the end of the day with a further few minutes on Friday 13 December 2013, in circumstances to which we refer at paragraph 43 below. The judge summed up the case over three days, beginning on Friday 13 December 2013 and concluding on Tuesday 17 December 2013. A unanimous verdict of guilty was returned after a retirement of 7 hours.
The criticism of Mr Wolkind
(a)
The law
22.
It was agreed that the law relating to the basis upon which an appeal against conviction grounded upon the incompetence of the advocate should be considered was correctly stated by Buxton LJ in
R v Day
[2003] EWCA Crim 1060
at paragraph 15:
“While incompetent representation is always to be deplored; is an understandable source of justified complaint by litigants and their families; and may expose the lawyers concerned to professional sanctions; it cannot in itself form a ground of appeal or a reason why a conviction should be found to be unsafe. We accept that, following the decision of this court in
Thakrar
[2001] EWCA Crim 1096
, the test is indeed the single test of safety, and that the court no longer has to concern itself with intermediate questions such as whether the advocacy has been flagrantly incompetent. But in order to establish lack of safety in an incompetence case the appellant has to go beyond the incompetence and show that the incompetence led to identifiable errors or irregularities in the trial, which themselves rendered the process unfair or unsafe.”
23.
At paragraph 52 of the decision of this court in
R v Bolivar & Lee
[2003] EWCA Crim 1167
the then Vice President, Rose LJ, had expressed the test:
“Professionalism requires that a barrister should do his job properly, disregarding such matters. Of course, if his performance on behalf of a client is affected by such matters, different considerations apply. Hence, in our judgment, the test to be applied in relation to a barrister's conduct, is: was it
Wednesbury
unreasonable and such as to affect the fairness of the trial?”
Both counsel submitted that the formulation was not apposite to the present case because that concerned advocacy affected by the personal circumstances of the barrister. We agree. In any event, the formulation by Buxton LJ is the more modern formulation. It is simpler to apply; it avoids consideration of how
Wednesbury
unreasonableness is to be applied to the conduct of an advocate; and it is more in accord with the formulation approved in a judgment of the Privy Council in Sankar v. State of Trinidad and Tobago
[1995] 1 W.L.R. 194
at 200F–G
.
(b)
The nature of the criticism
24.
It was the submission made on behalf of the appellant that where the prosecution case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence, the defence depended on competent cross-examination of the witnesses called by the prosecution, competent advice on whether the defendant should give evidence, competent examination of the defendant and a very carefully prepared speech for the defence. We are satisfied that Mr Wolkind told Mr Skelley on a number of occasions that it was a closing speech case.
25.
It was not suggested that Mr Wolkind was incompetent in the following respects:
i)
His advice on tactics.
ii)
His advice on calling witnesses, including the appellant.
iii)
His challenge to the admissibility of evidence.
iv)
His cross-examination of the witnesses called by the prosecution.
v)
His preparation for calling the appellant and his examination in chief of the appellant.
vi)
His agreement to the extensive agreed facts which were put before the jury and to the witness statements which were read to the jury.
26.
The case for the appellant presented by Mr Orlando Pownall QC was that Mr Wolkind’s incompetence related to the final speech for the defence and fell into two categories:
i)
a ‘severe criticism of style’ which itself amounted to incompetent representation in that he:
a)
failed to present the defence in an appropriate and focused manner;
b)
often resorted to patronising the jury, conducting personal attacks on counsel for the prosecution. He indulged in a number of inappropriate attempts at humour which were bound to alienate the jury;
ii)
a failure to confront the matters advanced by the prosecution by displaying (as had been reflected in submissions of no case to answer and in his opening submissions), a reluctance fully to engage with the issues before the jury in stark contrast to the detailed way in which the prosecution had advanced the case.
It was contended that Mr Wolkind had made the speech he did as the result of his failure before and during the trial to prepare himself properly for the trial and his lack of engagement in the trial and his doing of other work during the period he should have devoted himself to the defence of the appellant. He had substituted for proper preparation a speech that failed to rebut the case for the prosecution and relied instead on inappropriate diversions.
27.
Before dealing with the closing speech, it is necessary to set out briefly an account of the instruction of Mr Wolkind and his conduct of the defence during the trial.
The instruction of Mr Wolkind
28.
The appellant instructed Mr Michael Kaye of Kaye Tesler, Solicitors, from the time of his police interviews to which we have referred. Mr Kaye initially instructed Anthony Arlidge QC with Mr Michael Skelley of 18 Red Lion Court as his junior. As we have noted, he gave evidence before us. This put him in a very difficult position; however he considered it was his duty to give evidence in accordance with the high standards all barristers are expected to observe. He discharged that duty with complete integrity and gave his evidence with great clarity. We accept the entirety of his evidence; therefore where it conflicts with that of other witnesses we accept his account.
29.
After the hearing at which an attempt was made at dismissal in February 2013, the appellant decided to instruct Mr Wolkind. Mr Wolkind had been called to the bar in 1976 and been appointed one of Her Majesty’s Counsel in 1999; he practised at 2 Bedford Row. It appears that the appellant chose Mr Wolkind on the basis of Mr Wolkind’s personal website, “topcriminalqc”, (not that of his chambers) and some recommendations. Mr Skelley continued as the junior.
30.
After Mr Wolkind had been instructed, it is apparent from the e-mail correspondence that has been disclosed that Mr Wolkind had more than one conference with the appellant; it was made clear by Mr Wolkind that he would be concerned with the trial and leave all the early preparation to his junior and his instructing solicitor. It was the evidence of Mr Kaye, which was not disputed by Mr Wolkind, that Mr Wolkind told the appellant that in the period immediately preceding the trial there would be daily conferences.
The allegation that Mr Wolkind did not prepare the case properly
(a)
Position before the trial
31.
The trial was originally scheduled to begin on 7/8 October 2013, but then moved back to 21 October 2013. On 10 October 2013 Mr Wolkind informed his solicitor and the appellant that the first conference would be on 14 October 2013. The conference was brought forward as a result of the reaction of the appellant and his solicitors. In an e-mail of 9 October 2013, Mr Kaye reported that he was very concerned that Mr Wolkind was, “far from up to speed and was not concerned about that being obvious”. There was nothing that called that assessment by an experienced solicitor into question.
32.
The concern, which was discussed between Mr Skelley and Mr Kaye on 12 October 2013, was such that the possibility of dismissing Mr Wolkind was discussed. It was mooted that Mr Skelley should take the case over. Mr Skelley’s view was that it would not be appropriate for him to do so as he had never appeared on his own in a case of this size and complexity.
33.
On 21 October 2013 the trial date was put back to 31 October 2013. Daily conferences were not held in accordance with what Mr Wolkind had said to the appellant; only one is recorded. Mr Wolkind’s diary for that period lists several conferences in other matters as well as one appearance in another matter.
(b) The course of the prosecution case
34.
On 31 October 2013, the trial was called on. An application was made before the case was opened to exclude the evidence of a psychologist, Judith Halperin whom the prosecution sought to call. The application was prepared entirely by junior counsel. We are satisfied that Mr Wolkind had not read the material. He simply, though competently, presented what his junior counsel had prepared for him. The application was successful.
35.
As we have set out, there was no complaint that Mr Wolkind had failed to deal with the correct points on cross-examination. From the evidence that we have received it was clear that he relied very significantly on his junior for the points that were to be made. When the appellant asked Mr Wolkind why he had not asked a particular question or taken a certain approach, he would explain to the appellant that it was a closing speech case. Some evidence was given that pointed to Mr Wolkind’s lack of preparation for cross-examination; for example in the cross-examination of PC Vina Barrett a previous conviction of the appellant for possession of an offensive weapon was referred to when it should not have been. That resulted from Mr Wolkind asking the officer to read out parts of a document including that which contained the reference to the previous conviction, though it was wholly unnecessary for that particular passage to be read out. It was said that Mr Wolkind had not properly read the document, but this point was not put to Mr Wolkind.
36.
It is, in our view, unnecessary for us to make any findings in relation to his state of preparation for the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses; that is both because there was no criticism of the cross examination and for the reasons given at paragraph 53 below.
The submission of no case to answer
37.
As we have set out at paragraph 21 above, the prosecution closed its case on Wednesday 27 November 2013. There was then a day on which the court did not sit before the submission of no case to answer was to be made. Mr Skelley, as the junior, was engaged with Mr Tom Little, the junior for the prosecution, on that day in trying to agree the proposed agreed facts. Mr Skelley therefore told Mr Wolkind that he could not assist in preparing the submission of no case to answer. It appears from Mr Wolkind’s diary that he was engaged in another case in this court on that morning but in the afternoon there was a conference in the present case. That was concerned with the question as to whether the appellant should give evidence. There was no significant discussion of the submission of no case to answer.
38.
Mr Altman for the prosecution provided to the court a detailed 17 page submission as to why there was a case to answer. The written submission provided by Mr Wolkind to the judge was nine paragraphs long, extending over a page and a half. It was prefaced by the following:
“This document is written and provided to the court after receiving the prosecution’s submissions. The defence had prepared their own document but consider it easier now to respond to the prosecution.”
39.
Mr Wolkind told us that the document described as “their own document” had been prepared by him in manuscript; a copy was no longer available. We were told by Mr Wolkind that he considered that his nine paragraph document was sufficient and that he made such arguments as could be made orally. Although concise submissions are to be encouraged, we are entirely satisfied that the document put before the court was lamentable. It was a wholly inadequate response to what had been prepared on behalf of the prosecution; it was not the submission required to support the argument in a case where the evidence was entirely circumstantial. It was not just an error of judgment, but represented a serious failure on the part of Mr Wolkind. In fact, in determining this appeal nothing turns on this serious failure, since it is now rightly conceded that there was a case to answer, as the judge found.
The opening speech for the defence
40.
On 4 December 2013, Mr Wolkind opened the defence case. The speech was in large part a criticism of the prosecution case and entirely unfocussed. It also contained unwarranted and unjustifiable specific criticism of both Mr Altman and Mr Little. We return to this at paragraphs 59 and following. However, we need not consider the speech further as it is not said to be incompetent.
The evidence of the appellant
41.
Mr Wolkind told us that it was a difficult decision as to whether to call the appellant; he was worried as to the impression he would make. We understood and appreciated that concern. Indeed that risk eventuated. Mr Wolkind said he had to fight hard to “rescue him”. As we have set out at paragraph 21, the appellant commenced his evidence after the conclusion of the opening speech for the defence. Mr Skelley told us that he felt by that time Mr Wolkind was engaged in the case; he had therefore commented to Mr Wolkind that, “You have had a good day at the office”. No criticism is, as we have said, made of the examination of the appellant.
42.
Evidence was given to us by Mr Skelley that during the cross examination Mr Wolkind, whilst half listening to the evidence, was sending e-mails on other cases.
The events after the closing speech
43.
Before turning to the closing speech, it is necessary to refer to Mr Wolkind’s conduct during the summing up. Very little of the summing up was delivered on Friday 13 December 2013, as a juror became ill. When the judge resumed on Monday 16 December 2013, Mr Wolkind arrived part of the way through the morning and then left during the course of the afternoon. The appellant decided in those circumstances to terminate his instructions to Mr Wolkind and to continue with Mr Skelley alone. Mr Wolkind told us that he had been late because of a delay in a video conference he had arranged, according to his diary, for 10:00 for another case, where the defendant was held in prison. His diary showed that at 15:00 he had a meeting in another case. The consequence of Mr Wolkind’s dismissal was that he was not present on the following day when there was an exchange between Mr Altman and the judge about the answers of the defence to the detailed case made by the prosecution. We refer to this at paragraph 48 below.
The closing speech
(a)
The instructions not to complete the closing speech
44.
As we have set out at paragraph 21 above, the defence speech began at 12:15 on Thursday12 December 2013. Mr Wolkind had had no real discussion with his junior and no discussion with his solicitor or the appellant before the speech. In consequence, Mr Kaye spoke to Mr Wolkind at 13:55 and asked him not to close his speech that day. Mr Wolkind did not reply but Mr Kaye looked on this as an instruction and assumed Mr Wolkind would not finish that afternoon. When the speech came to an end, towards the close of the day, Mr Kaye, as he told us, was very angry. He spoke to Mr Wolkind who agreed that he would say a little more on the following morning. He did so.
45.
Although this was a matter of complaint against Mr Wolkind, it was misconceived. Mr Wolkind was under no duty to act on instructions of this kind. In
R v Farooqi
[2014] 1 Crim App R 8
,
[2013] EWCA Crim 1649
, Lord Judge CJ in giving the judgment of the court set out the duties of the advocate in relation to instructions given by a defendant in a trial at paragraphs 107 to 109. He made clear that the conduct of the case was the responsibility of the trial advocate. His instructions were contained in the defendant’s account of what had happened; it was the advocate alone who remained responsible for the forensic decisions and strategy.
“That is the foundation for the right to appear as an advocate, with the privileges and responsibilities of advocates and as an advocate, burdened with twin responsibilities, both to the client and to the court.”
46.
There is, in our view therefore, no basis upon which an advocate can be instructed as to what to say in his closing speech by his solicitor or by his client or when to conclude it. That is the advocate’s responsibility. Thus, although we understand the concern of Mr Kaye and the appellant, no criticism can attach to Mr Wolkind for disregarding what was said as to the time when he should conclude his speech. That was a matter for his judgment, bearing in mind his duties to the appellant and to the court. That was, however, a very minor part of the complaint against the way in which Mr Wolkind had dealt with the closing speech.
(b)
The case made on appeal about the speech
47.
We have referred at paragraph 26 to the case made by Mr Pownall on behalf of the appellant. It was further submitted that during the trial Mr Wolkind had led the appellant, Mr Kaye and Mr Skelley to believe that he had been “harvesting” or “gathering” points to make in his closing speech and that he would make a detailed closing speech in rebuttal of the detailed closing speech that had been delivered by Mr Altman. The complaint was that Mr Wolkind had not made a closing speech which would rebut the points that had been made by the prosecution and explain the case properly to the jury. As was put in advice to the appellant on 8 January 2014:
“We agree that he had all of the ammunition but then did not fire it.”
48.
It was submitted that the incompetent nature of the defence closing speech had clearly caused the judge concern:
i)
On Tuesday 17 December 2013, after Mr Wolkind had been dismissed in the circumstances to which we have referred in paragraph 43, there occurred the exchange between the judge and Mr Altman to which we there referred. At the start of the day, Mr Altman raised a detailed question in relation to the summing up; the judge then referred to his duty to deliver a balanced summing up:
“What we have here is a contrast between a prosecution who put their case on a very detailed analysis of the whole succession of facts. Mr Wolkind has not sought to answer those facts in detail.”
After Mr Altman had observed that was often a question of style, the judge continued:
“But there is a problem therefore, for a judge giving a balanced summing up, in that making a succession of prosecution points which have not be answered in detail, I have to go rather carefully, lest I give the impression this is simply a review of the prosecution case.”
ii)
Mr Altman responded that the prosecution’s position was that simply because important and significant points were not answered was not a reason for not airing them. He emphasised that this was a detailed circumstantial case and the devil lay in the detail.
iii)
There followed numerous passages in the summing-up where the judge had pointed to the way the prosecution had put their case and emphasised that it was a “circumstantial case where the devil is in the detail”. We were taken to examples in the summing-up where the judge had put the detailed nature of the points made by the prosecution, but where there was no readily apparent answer from the defence.
(c)
The way the speech was prepared
49.
Mr Wolkind told us that he had, as he had explained to the appellant (as we have set out at paragraph 47 above), been keeping a list of points. From notes provided to us by Mr Wolkind it appears that he had prepared on his computer a first draft on Tuesday 10 December 2013 at 20.38, comprising two pages and a further draft of seven pages at 20:33 on Wednesday 11 December 2013. The final draft headed “Closing speech at 1.24” was timed at 08:41 on Thursday 12 December 2013. At 08:47 on that day Mr Wolkind sent to Mr Skelley an e-mail:
“A man who worked till after 2 and restarted at 6 will be a little late arriving. If I am not in the building by close to 10 please tell the court I am on my way and should be there by 10.20.”
The court was due to sit at 10:15 and did indeed start at 10:15.
The evidence of Mr Skelley
50.
It was Mr Skelley’s evidence that he prepared and provided to Mr Wolkind three documents entitled “Closing speech points”. He was not convinced Mr Wolkind was developing the points that needed to be made and had not been invited by Mr Wolkind to discuss the speech or to contribute to its drafting; he had told Mr Skelley it was his speech The first of the three documents, provided on 10 December at 23:31, was a document of some 12 pages. The second a document of two pages and the third a document of five pages were sent on 11 December 2013. These three documents contained detailed points in relation to the circumstantial evidence in the case.
(d)
An analysis of the speech
51.
Mr Altman QC who appeared on the appeal for the prosecution helpfully provided us with a detailed analysis of Mr Wolkind’s closing speech. From that analysis and our detailed consideration of the closing speech, the following emerges:
i)
There were six themes of criticism of the prosecution case that formed the basis of Mr Wolkind’s speech: (i) “random attacks”, (ii) “speculation”, (iii) “pet theories”, (iv) “prejudice”, (v) “distortion” and (vi) “mistakes”.
ii)
The speech was developed round these themes. All the points that had been put forward by Mr Skelley in the three documents to which we have referred, were incorporated, sometimes with specific attribution to Mr Skelley, but there was little more.
52.
We have asked ourselves the question, therefore, whether the speech can be described having reached a level of incompetence that called into question the safety of the conviction or the fairness of the trial. We cannot so describe it. Although it will be for others to consider wider issues, it was a speech that covered the points and it had a structure, however ill-judged the themes and the structure might have been. We accept as amply justified the criticism made by Mr Pownall that it was ill-judged, patronising and contained inappropriate attempts at humour. It also contained observations about prosecuting counsel which, as Mr Skelley told us, were completely unprofessional; no advocate should have put these observations into a speech, as we shall observe at paragraphs 59 and following below. However it did not reach a level of incompetence that called into question the fairness of the trial or safety of the conviction.
53.
As we have reached that view, it would not be appropriate for us to make more general findings in relation to Mr Wolkind’s lack of preparation and conduct of the case. That must be a matter for the Bar Standards Board to which we direct the matter be referred.
The safety of the conviction
54.
Although we grant leave to appeal against conviction, we are satisfied that the sole ground on which it is advanced fails. We have considered the entirety of the evidence and see no reason to doubt the safety of the conviction. There were very telling points against the appellant such as the inherent unlikelihood of the wife leaving the flat on an October night with a suitcase given the location of the flat in Hampstead, the failure of the appellant to make inquiries about his wife though she was bearing his child, the refurbishment of the flat and the finding of the ring.
The application for leave to appeal against sentence
55.
We refuse leave to appeal against the minimum term of 22 years imposed. The judge took the correct starting point of 15 years. The concealment of the body in such a way that it has never been found and the fact that his wife was pregnant to his knowledge when he murdered her are both seriously aggravating factors that justified the significant increase above the minimum term.
Concluding directions observations
(a)
Websites
56.
Our attention was drawn to Mr Wolkind’s personal website. We were surprised at its content and tone. However whether it is within the proper bounds of professional conduct for a member of the bar, particularly one who has had since 1999 the status of being one of Her Majesty’s Counsel, is a matter which we direct be referred to the Bar Standards Board for their consideration.
(b) Carrying out other work
57.
We have had to make some express findings in relation to other work that Mr Wolkind was carrying out during this very complex murder trial. The fact that Mr Wolkind was doing so plainly caused the appellant very considerable concern and led to his dismissal of Mr Wolkind. However, it would not be right for us to make any observations. The terms upon which any barrister, particularly one of Her Majesty’s counsel, is free to engage on other work during the conduct of a case is a matter for the Bar Standards Board, subject to an overriding duty to the court in respect of the case before the court. We therefore direct that general issue be referred to the Bar Standards Board for their consideration.
(c)
Defence closing speeches
58.
Unsurprisingly we were not referred to any decided case in which an incompetent defence speech has provided the grounds for a successful appeal. As was demonstrated in
Farooqi
the trial judge has the responsibility and ample scope to ensure that a defendant's case is accurately before the jury. That task may involve correcting or amplifying a closing speech. Should that prove impossible it may, in an extreme case, be necessary to discharge the jury. In the present case no such criticism has or can be made.
(d)
Personal criticism of opposing advocates in addresses to the jury
59.
Finally, there is one feature of the conduct of this case which judges must ensure ceases immediately and not be repeated in any case. That conduct is making in an address to the jury personal criticism of opposing advocates in contradistinction to criticism of the prosecution case.
60.
We were told that the practice of making personal criticism of prosecution advocates has become a feature of some addresses to the jury made by defence advocates. In this case the personal criticism of Mr Altman and Mr Little by Mr Wolkind should not have been made in his addresses to the jury.
61.
If any advocate has a criticism of the personal conduct of an opposing advocate that is a matter that should be raised before the judge who will deal with it then and there, though, in what we hope would be the rarest of circumstances, it could be referred to the professional disciplinary body.
62.
The conduct of a trial before a jury requires proper and professional conduct by all advocates in speeches to the jury. As any personal criticism of the conduct of an opposing advocate is a matter for the judge, it can form no proper part of an address to a jury. The regrettable departure from proper standards of advocacy by making personal criticisms of advocates of an opposing party in an address to the jury must therefore cease. No court will tolerate its continuance.","citation:

J U D G M E N T
1.
LORD JUSTICE LATHAM: On 28th June 2007, in the Crown court at Ipswich, the appellant was convicted of racially aggravated assault by beating. The wording of the count was as follows:
""Richard John Babbs on the 16th day of October 2006 assaulted Kazol Miah by beating and at the time of doing so, or immediately before doing so demonstrated towards Kazol Miah hostility based on his membership or presumed membership of a particular racial group such that the offence was racially aggravated within the meaning of
Section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998
.""
He was in breach of a suspended sentence and on 24th July 2007 was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment in relation to the offence with which we are concerned and was further sentenced to a consecutive sentence of 16 weeks' imprisonment, which was giving effect to the suspended sentence to which he was subject. He appeals against conviction by leave of the Single Judge.
2.
The evidence before the jury was, firstly, the evidence of Kazol Miah, who was the victim; a companion, Margiul Dexter-Baxter; and the manager of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in which the events with which we are concerned took place.
3.
The victim and his companion were awaiting service in the restaurant and in the queue was the appellant. It is apparent that the appellant had seen the victim and the person he described as his wife in the neighbourhood and, it would appear it may well be because he was affected by drink, the appellant started to abuse the victim and his companion. The evidence of the victim was that the appellant said:
""You're living on the system. You're conning the system. You foreign fuckers, you do not deserve to be here.""
There was undoubtedly a scuffle and an argument at that stage, which the manager of the restaurant and other members of the staff manage to quell. For a time, which was variously estimated as between five and 15 minutes, there was no further difficulty between the appellant and the victim and his companion. However, there came a time when the appellant managed to get to the head of the queue, it would appear having queue jumped so far as the appellant was concerned. He got his food and, as he passed the victim, he waved his bag of food in front of the victim, making it apparent that he was gloating over the fact that he had managed to be served first. He was not simply gloating but he was also aggressive and said words to suggest that the two of them should go outside, with the implication that they should fight. The appellant said that at that stage the victim called him ""white trash"" and indeed there was support for that from the manager of the restaurant. Whatever may be the case, the appellant then headbutted the victim. That was the incident upon which the charge was based.
4.
The appellant never denied that he had headbutted the victim and indeed was prepared to plead guilty to assault, in other words accepting that he had no lawful excuse for doing so. He denied, however, that he had ever said the words attributed to him by the victim describing the victim and his companion as ""foreign fuckers"". That was therefore the factual issue between the prosecution and the defence at the trial. However, counsel on behalf of the appellant submitted at the end of the prosecution case that, even on the prosecution's evidence, the count charged was not made out because the words used had not been spoken immediately before the incident of assault so as to justify the conclusion that the racially aggravated form of the offence had been committed.
5.
The racially aggravated form of the offence can be committed in two ways: firstly, as charged in this case under
section 28(1)(a)
of the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
, when, at the time of committing the offence or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrates towards the victim of the offence hostility based on his membership (or presumed membership) of a particular racial group or, alternatively, under
section 28(1)(b)
, that the offence was motivated, wholly or partly, by such hostility.
6.
The judge was referred to the case of
Parry v DPP
[2004] EWHC 3112 (Admin)
in which the divisional court had considered the effect of
section 28(1)(a)
. Giving the judgment of the court in that case, Field J described the requirement of immediacy as requiring the hostility shown to be ""in the immediate context of the substantive offence"". In that case, the words which indicated racial hostility had been spoken some 20 minutes or so after the incident in question, after the offender had left the scene and had indeed arrived home and were spoken in the absence of the victim. The court there held that there was no sufficient connection between the words used and the offence. The judge in the present case rejected the submission on the basis that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury to establish that there was a connection between the words that were used and the event as to meet the requirements of
section 28(1)(a)
.
7.
Mr Durr, in presenting this appeal, submits in the first instance that the judge was wrong to leave the matter to the jury. He submits there was no sufficient connection established as to justify the conclusion that the subsection's requirements were met.
8.
It seems to us that the judge was entitled to leave the matter to the jury. Although he talked in terms of continuum, the point that is of importance in the subsection is that it is directed not so much to words but to the hostility which is demonstrated towards a victim with the relevant connotation. The words used by the appellant were, it seems to us, capable of colouring the behaviour of the appellant throughout the subsequent events. He had evinced hostility which, by reason of the words he used, could be said to have been based upon race. The jury were perfectly entitled to conclude that the hostility shown later was based upon the same reasoning, if reasoning is the right description of it, that had been evinced in the words that the appellant had used earlier and, accordingly, that hostility based upon race was evinced over a continuing period from the moment that the words were first used to the moment that it exploded into the ultimate violence in question.
9.
If that be the correct approach, the question then is whether the judge directed the jury properly in relation to the events that evening. The judge in his summing-up seems in the first instance to have directed the jury simply to look at the words themselves when at one point in his summing-up he said, as to the question which the jury had to ask itself:
""Were they [the words] said immediately before the assault alleged. That is the second issue.""
For the reason that we have given, that may have been a rather simplistic way of putting the matter to the jury; but the judge then went on to make it plain that he was giving them that direction in the context of the issue which he subsequently refined as ""did the appellant demonstrate hostility immediately before assaulting the victim"", and he ultimately left the jury with the following direction:
""'Are we satisfied that immediately before doing so he demonstrated to me [sic] a hostility based on his membership of a particular racial group?""
10.
The judge made it plain that that was an issue of fact for the jury to determine. It seems to us that he was correct to do so and adequately indicated to the jury that they had to determine the question of whether or not the words used had so affected the subsequent behaviour as to justify the conclusion that in the end the hostility which was clearly evinced immediately before the assault was indeed affected by the racial connotation implied in the words used earlier. For those reasons, we consider that this verdict was entirely safe and we dismiss the appeal.","citation:

Mr A Rollin
appeared on behalf of the
Appellant
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
J U D G M E N T
1.
MR JUSTICE SIMON: On 17th November 2008 at Canterbury Crown Court, the appellant, now aged 33, pleaded guilty to two counts on a new indictment. On 18th December she was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on count 2, which charged an offence of having an offensive weapon, and to six months' imprisonment to be served concurrently on count 1, which charged her with an assault. The overall sentence was therefore two years, with 94 days spent on remand to count towards that sentence. An earlier indictment containing counts charging assault occasioning actual bodily harm and having an offensive weapon was stayed. She appeals against that sentence with the leave of the single judge.
2.
The circumstances giving rise to the offence were these. The appellant worked at an Asda store in Canterbury, where she befriended a woman named W, who also worked at the store. The appellant gave to Miss W the mobile telephone number of a man with whom the appellant had previously been in a relationship. When the two of them began to see each other the appellant became jealous. It appears that she threw a bottle of water at Miss W, which led to her dismissal from employment at the store.
3.
On 15th September 2008 she went back to the store, selected a large kitchen knife from a display and removed it from its packaging. She then went up to Miss W, who was working at one of the check-out tills, and pulled her hair back, causing some reddening of the scalp. That assault gave rise to the charge under count 1. At this point, more seriously, the appellant then put the point of the knife she was carrying to Miss W's throat. She struggled and called out for help; and then sensed the knife being moved across her throat to the side of her neck. This gave rise to the charge under count 2. Two members of staff came over at this point, pulled the appellant away and disarmed her, suffering minor cuts to her hands as they did so. The appellant was restrained but continued to shout, ""You've ruined my life"", at the complainant.
4.
In interview the appellant said she had gone back to the store to see old colleagues, but the sight of the complainant had brought back all her old feelings of jealousy and resentment. She said she did not intend to hurt her and that the victim had not deserved what had happened to her. She said to the police, ""I must tell you, I feel really guilty, I can't believe I really did it"".
5.
She had not previously appeared before the courts and the pre-sentence report described her as demonstrating insight and remorse. She had become preoccupied with the complainant and fantasised about harming her because of her relationship with a man with whom the appellant had a brief relationship. She had used the complainant as a focus for her problems and negative feelings. She had been aggressive towards the complainant on a previous occasion. Distorted and obsessive thought processes underlay the offences. She struggled to develop satisfactory relationships with others, misinterpreted positive attention and quickly became emotionally attached. The risk of re-offending was low to medium. She had a history of depression and used alcohol as a coping mechanism. In the view of the writer of the pre-sentence report she posed a high risk of self-harm and suicide attempts. The report proposed a community or suspended sentence order with supervision and exclusion requirements.
6.
The psychiatric report which was available to the judge described a history of mild depressive episodes, which had been treated with anti-depressant medication, and an adjustment disorder following the break up of her relationship. She was not, however, suffering from any significant psychiatric illness. She had a lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem. She bottled up anger and frustration and this had led to an uncharacteristic episode. She would benefit from the ongoing use of anti-depressant medication and counselling or group therapy. She was vulnerable to developing a more depressive condition if faced with significant or prolonged stress, such as a lengthy custodial sentence.
7.
In passing sentence, the judge set out the facts and accepted that the incident would not have gone any further. In his view the offence was committed in the context of knife crime that was rife and getting out of control. In mitigation were her guilty pleas and the contents of the pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. There had to be a significant custodial sentence so that the public could feel sure that the courts were protecting them. Her personal needs had to come second to that, and they would be dealt with in prison so far as possible.
8.
In the grounds of appeal supplemented orally today by Mr Rollin it is said that the sentence of two years did not reflect the absence of a number of aggravating circumstances and laid too much emphasis on aggravating circumstances which were not, on proper analysis, such.
9.
We should say at once that we do not agree with the suggestion in the pre-sentence report that a community sentence should have been imposed. The taking of and the deployment of the knife was a calculated act and was bound to cause extreme fear to the victim and a high degree of anxiety to those who saw what happened. The danger implicit in the appellant's actions is demonstrated by the injuries, albeit minor, suffered by those who tried to disarm her. On the other hand, there were a number of mitigating factors. The appellant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to this charge and had expressed remorse too at a very early stage. Although this would not have been known to the victim, the judge accepted that the incident would not have gone any further. The crime did not have the aggravating features identified by this court in
R v Pouton and Celaire
[2002] EWCA Crim 2487
. Furthermore, there were no previous convictions for violence or carrying weapons. Indeed, the appellant had a positive good character. The weapon had not been carried around with the intention of using it if the occasion arose and was not used with the clear intention of causing fear, although this would plainly have been the consequence.
10.
In our view, the judge was wrong to treat this case as conforming to the type of crime with which the public and the courts are particularly concerned: the habitual carrying of knives with the associated risk to public safety, see the guideline case of
R v Povey and others
[2008] EWCA Crim 1261
.
11.
In the light of these circumstances we have concluded that a three year starting point was too high and the appropriate sentence was one of 18 months' imprisonment on count 2 and three months' imprisonment concurrently on count 1 to take into account the guilty plea, therefore 18 months' imprisonment in total. We therefore quash the sentence of two years' imprisonment and the sentence of six months' imprisonment and substitute these sentences. To that extent the appeal is allowed.","citation:

LADY JUSTICE CARR:
Introduction
1.
On 18 May 2022 the applicant, then 22 years old, was convicted following trial before His Honour Judge Leonard KC and a jury of the murder of Lee Baxter (""Mr Baxter""). He was sentenced on 10 June 2022 to imprisonment for life with a minimum term under section 322 of the Sentencing Act 2020 of 29 years less 595 days spent on remand.
2.
Two of his co-accused were also convicted of the murder. Jermaine Forrester, then 25 years old, was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 29 years, less time spent on remand. Ryan Graham, then 27 years old, was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 27 years, less time spent on remand.
3.
This is his renewed application for leave to appeal sentence, for which purpose he has had the benefit of
pro bono
representation by Mr Turner KC. The central basis of challenge is disparity. It is said that the judge erred in assessing the culpability of the applicant as equivalent to that of Forrester and greater than that of Graham, reaching a sentence that was manifestly excessive as a result.
The facts
4.
In summary, the facts are as follows. On the evening of 9 October 2020, Mr Baxter, then 34 years old, and his brother drove to Pavilion Terrace in Ilford with the intention of purchasing a large quantity of cannabis. He had £5,000 in cash with him. The applicant, together with Forrester and Graham, were already at the scene, having been driven there by a woman named Demi Anderson. She stayed in her vehicle.
5.
There was discussion amongst the group. Mr Baxter showed the men the cash. The cannabis, however, did not materialise. Mr Baxter and his brother began to leave, making their way down an alleyway, but followed by the applicant, Forrester and Graham.
6.
Very quickly upon entering the alleyway, Forrester attacked Mr Baxter, placing him in a headlock. Graham joined in, helping to force Mr Baxter to the ground where Mr Baxter was then stabbed. The applicant produced a knife and chased Mr Baxter's brother, swinging the knife and only narrowly missing him. Mr Baxter's brother ran back to his car from where he witnessed the continuing attack on Mr Baxter. The applicant then joined in that attack which only stopped when Mr Baxter's brother returned towards them. The applicant, Forrester and Graham then fled.
7.
Mr Baxter had been stabbed multiple times. There were 11 distinct incised wounds, two considered to be defensive, and nine stab wounds. The fatal wound passed through Mr Baxter's thigh through muscle causing damage to the femoral artery and vein. The total depth of this injury was 10 centimetres. It caused massive blood loss and, despite medical assistance, Mr Baxter tragically died at the scene.
8.
Following the attack, Anderson drove the applicant, Forrester and Graham back to their respective addresses. The men then made efforts to cover up their involvement. One of the knives used was cleaned with bleach, communications on mobile telephones were deleted, and bloodstained clothes were disposed of or washed.
The sentence
9.
The judge concluded on the facts, amongst other things: (1) that all three went out ready to use knives against Baxter; (2) that the applicant used his knife to chase Mr Baxter's brother away, leaving Mr Baxter defenceless; (3) that Forrester was the first to stab Mr Baxter and was the principal stabber; (4) that the applicant had a knife with him but it could not be said with surety that he had stabbed Mr Baxter; (5) that it could not be said with surety that Graham was armed with a knife; (6) that the applicant was in general terms the ringleader due to his intelligence; (7) if the events had begun as a genuine agreement to sell cannabis, there came a time on the scene when the plan changed to one of robbery. The timing however made very little difference to the sentence; (8) that really serious harm, not death, was intended.
Grounds of appeal
10.
At the outset Mr Turner submits that the judge gave insufficient weight to two specific factors: first, the applicant's youth - he was only 22 at the time; and secondly, that the applicant did not stab Mr Baxter.
11.
Separately and in any event, it is suggested that the minimum term of 29 years for the applicant was manifestly excessive when compared to the sentences on Forrester and Graham. In particular, Forrester was the principal and potentially only stabber who initiated the attack, and the applicant was to be treated as not having stabbed Mr Baxter at all. Secondly, the applicant was the youngest of the three men and not heavily convicted, especially when compared with Forrester who had previous convictions including for robbery and possession of a bladed article. Thirdly, if a common plan to rob Mr Baxter did arise, it did so on the spur of the moment. Fourthly, there was no safe basis on which to conclude that the applicant was aware in advance that Forrester would stab Mr Baxter.
12.
Thus, it is suggested that the roles and culpability of the applicant and Forrester were not equivalent, and that Graham's culpability was no less than that of the applicant.
Discussion
13.
The judge sentenced the applicant without a pre-sentence report. We agree that one was not necessary and there has been no suggestion to the contrary.
14.
It is usually difficult to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive by reference to disparity alone. Disparity is rarely a successful ground of appeal: see
R v Wilson
[2017] EWCA Crim 1860, [2018] 1 Cr.App.R (S) 25 and
R v Anderson and Black
[2018] EWCA Crim 482. One sentencing error is not cured by making another. The sole statutory test on appeal is whether a sentence was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.
15.
It is rightly accepted that the judge correctly identified a minimum term of 30 years as the relevant starting point on the basis that this was a murder done for gain for the purpose of paragraph 3(2) of schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020. He elevated it to take account of relevant aggravating factors, including the fact that this was a group attack, the background of drug dealing, and the efforts to dispose of clothing and knives. He then reduced it to accommodate the relevant mitigation, including the fact that the applicant had a young child and had ADHD.
16.
He considered the applicant's age, in our judgment, with conspicuous care. He correctly focused on maturity and not age itself. Having heard the applicant give evidence and taking into account the applicant's background, he was entitled to conclude as he did, namely that the applicant was not ""immature in any respect"". The applicant was running a substantial drugs business and clearly capable of influencing what Forrester and Graham did.
17.
There is in our judgment no arguable basis on which to impugn the resulting minimum term of 29 years as such.
18.
Arguments by reference to disparity in such circumstances would not assist, for the reasons that we have already identified. In any event, the judge was well-placed after trial to assess the respective roles and culpability of those involved. This assessment was something to which he gave careful thought, as is clear from the face of his sentencing remarks. An exercise of detailed comparison between the various roles and circumstances of the three men proves unrewarding.
19.
There were many matters of commonality. This was a joint enterprise, all three were ready to use knives against Mr Baxter from the moment they set out that evening. There was at some stage before going to the alleyway a joint decision to rob Mr Baxter of £5,000. Each offender had a young child. There were also differences, sometimes nuanced, between the respective positions of the applicant and his co-defendants. By way of example only, although the applicant was the youngest of the three men, the judge found that he was the ringleader within the group, an intelligent and high-functioning individual. This was a central and primary consideration in sentencing terms for the applicant. Graham, who had many positive good character references, was assessed as having special educational needs at school and had no previous convictions. He was also a follower and not a leader. Forrester had dyslexia which had held him back educationally and had a troubled family background.
20.
In short, there is no real prospect of appellate interference with the judge's overall evaluative assessments of the individual roles and culpability of those involved, or the resulting sentence on the applicant that he imposed.
Conclusion
21.
For these reasons, we refuse this renewed application.  We conclude, nevertheless, by repeating our thanks to Mr Turner for his assistance.
